Set up Google Cloud so that Cloud Volumes ONTAP is ready to tier cold data and back up volumes to low-cost object storage in Google Cloud.

== Configure the Cloud Volumes ONTAP subnet for Private Google Access

These steps are required if you want to enable data tiering to object storage.

.Steps

. In the Google Cloud console, https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/networks/list[go to the VPC networks page^].

. For an existing subnet, click *Edit* and then select *On* under *Private Google Access*.

. For a new subnet, click *Add subnet*, provide the required information, and select *On* under *Private Google Access*.

https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access#config-pga[Go to Google Cloud documentation for more information^].

== Create a service account

These steps are required if you want to enable data tiering to object storage and if you want to back up volumes to object storage using the Cloud Backup Service.

You can set up one service account and use it for both purposes.

.Steps

. In the Google Cloud console, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[go to the Service accounts page^].

. Select your project.

. Click *Create service account* and provide the required information.

.. *Service account details*: Enter a name and description.
.. *Grant this service account access to project*: Select the *Storage Admin* role.

+
.. *Grant users access to this service account*: Add the Connector service account as a _Service Account User_ to this new service account.
+
NOTE: This step is required for data tiering only. It's not required for the Cloud Backup Service.

You'll need to select this tiering service account later when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.
+
If you don't enable data tiering and select a service account when you create the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, then you'll need to turn off the system and add the service account to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the GCP console.
