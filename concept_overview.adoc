Cloud Manager enables IT experts and cloud architects to centrally manage their hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure using NetApp's cloud solutions.

== Features

Cloud Manager is an enterprise-class, SaaS-based management platform that keeps you in control of your data no matter where it is.

* Set up and use Cloud Volumes ONTAP for efficient, multi-protocol data management across clouds
* Set up and use file-storage services: Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Volumes Service for AWS, and Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud
* Discover and manage your on-prem ONTAP clusters by creating volumes, replicating data across your hybrid cloud, and tiering cold data to the cloud
* Enable integrated cloud services and software like Cloud Compliance, Cloud Insights, Cloud Backup Service, Trident, and more.

Cloud Manager was built with simplicity in mind. It guides you through Cloud Volumes ONTAP setup in a few steps, eases data management by offering simplified storage provisioning and automated capacity management, enables drag-and-drop data replication across a hybrid cloud, and more.

== Supported object storage providers

Cloud Manager enables you to manage cloud storage and use cloud services in Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

== Cost

Cloud Manager software is free of charge from NetApp.

For most tasks, Cloud Manager prompts you to deploy a Connector in your cloud network, which results in charges from your cloud provider for the compute instance and associated storage. You do have the option to run the Connector software on your premises.

== How Cloud Manager works

Cloud Manager includes a SaaS-based interface that is integrated with NetApp Cloud Central, and Connectors that manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other cloud services.

=== SaaS user interface

The Cloud Manager interface is accessible through a SaaS-based user interface. This SaaS experience enables you to automatically access the latest features as they're released and to easily switch between your Cloud Central accounts and Connectors.

=== NetApp Cloud Central

https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^] provides a centralized location to access and manage https://www.netapp.com/us/products/cloud-services/use-cases-for-netapp-cloud-services.aspx[NetApp cloud services^].

With centralized user authentication, you can use the same set of credentials to access  Cloud Manager and other cloud services like Cloud Insights.

When you log in to Cloud Manager for the first time, you're prompted to create a Cloud Central account. This account provides multi-tenancy and enables you to organize users and resources in isolated _workspaces_.

=== Connectors

In most cases, you will need to deploy a _Connector_ in your cloud or on-premises network. The Connector enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

A Connector should remain running at all times. It's important for the continued health and operation of the services that you enable.
