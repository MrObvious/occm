Complete a few steps to get started with Cloud Compliance for Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Review prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure that your cloud environment can meet the prerequisites, which includes 16 vCPUs for the Cloud Compliance instance, outbound internet access for the instance, connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Compliance over port 80, and more. <<Reviewing prerequisites,See the complete list>>.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Deploy the Cloud Compliance instance

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Deploy Cloud Compliance in Cloud Manager.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Enable Cloud Compliance in your working environments

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* New working environments: Be sure to keep Cloud Compliance enabled when you create the working environment (it's enabled by default).

* Existing working environments: Click *Compliance*, optionally edit the list of working environments, and click *Show Compliance Dashboard*.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Ensure access to volumes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Now that Cloud Compliance is enabled, ensure that it can access volumes.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* The Cloud Compliance instance needs a network connection to each Cloud Volumes ONTAP subnet or Azure NetApp Files subnet.
* Security groups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP must allow inbound connections from the Cloud Compliance instance.
* NFS volume export policies must allow access from the Cloud Compliance instance.
* Cloud Compliance needs Active Directory credentials to scan CIFS volumes.
+
Click *Compliance* > *Scan Configuration* > *Edit CIFS Credentials* and provide the credentials. The credentials can be read-only, but providing admin credentials ensures that Cloud Compliance can read data that requires elevated permissions.

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Configure volumes to scan

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the volume that you'd like to scan and Cloud Compliance will start scanning them.

== Reviewing prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Compliance. You'll need to ensure connectivity to volumes after you enable Cloud Compliance. That's covered below.

Enable outbound internet access::
Cloud Compliance requires outbound internet access. If your virtual network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the Cloud Compliance instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints. Note that Cloud Manager deploys the Cloud Compliance instance in the same subnet as the Connector.

Ensure that Cloud Manager has the required permissions::
Ensure that Cloud Manager has permissions to deploy resources and create security groups for the Cloud Compliance instance. You can find the latest Cloud Manager permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[the policies provided by NetApp^].

Check your vCPU limits::
Ensure that your cloud provider's vCPU limit allows for the deployment of an instance with 16 cores. You'll need to verify the vCPU limit for the relevant instance family in the region where Cloud Manager is running.
+
In AWS, the instance family is _On-Demand Standard instances_. In Azure, the instance family is _Standard DSv3 Family_.
+
For more details on vCPU limits, see the following:
+
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[AWS documentation: Amazon EC2 Service Limits^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quotas[Azure documentation: Virtual machine vCPU quotas^]

Ensure that Cloud Manager can access Cloud Compliance::
Ensure connectivity between the Connector and the Cloud Compliance instance:

* The security group for the Connector must allow inbound and outbound traffic over port 80 to and from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
This connection enables deployment of the Cloud Compliance instance and enables you to view information in the Compliance tab.

* If your AWS network doesnâ€™t use a NAT or proxy for internet access, modify the security group for the Connector to allow inbound traffic over TCP port 3128 from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
This is required because the Cloud Compliance instance uses the Connector as a proxy to access the internet.
+
NOTE: This port is open by default on all new Connector instances, starting with version 3.7.5. It's not open on instances created prior to that.

Set up discovery of Azure NetApp Files::
Before you can scan volumes for Azure NetApp Files, link:task_manage_anf.html[Cloud Manager must be set up to discover the configuration].

Ensure that you can keep Cloud Compliance running::
The Cloud Compliance instance needs to stay on to continuously scan your data.

Ensure web browser connectivity to Cloud Compliance::
After Cloud Compliance is enabled, ensure that users access the Cloud Manager interface from a host that has a connection to the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
The Cloud Compliance instance uses a private IP address to ensure that the indexed data isn't accessible to the internet. As a result, the web browser that you use to access Cloud Manager must have a connection to that private IP address. That connection can come from a direct connection to AWS or Azure (for example, a VPN), or from a host that's inside the same network as the Cloud Compliance instance.

== Deploying the Cloud Compliance instance

You deploy an instance of Cloud Compliance for each Cloud Manager instance.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, click *Compliance*.

. Click *Activate Cloud Compliance* to start the deployment wizard.
+

. The wizard displays progress as it goes through the deployment steps. It will stop and ask for input if it runs into any issues.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_wizard_start.png[A screenshot of the Cloud Compliance wizard to deploy a new instance.]

. When the instance in deployed, click *Continue to configuration* to go to the _Scan Configuration_ page.

.Result

Cloud Manager deploys the Cloud Compliance instance in your cloud provider.

From the Scan Configuration page you can select the working environments, volumes, and buckets that you want to scan for compliance. You can also connect to a database server in order to scan specific schemas.

== Enabling Cloud Compliance on a new working environment

Cloud Compliance is enabled by default in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

As long as you already deployed an instance of Cloud Compliance, Cloud Compliance starts scanning the data in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance as soon as it is available.

.Steps

. Click *Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Select Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure as the cloud provider and then choose a single node or HA system.

. Fill out the Details & Credentials page.

. On the Services page, leave Cloud Compliance enabled and click *Continue*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance.gif[A screenshot that shows the Services page in the working environment wizard.]

. Complete the pages in the wizard to deploy the system.
+
For help, see link:task_deploying_otc_aws.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS] and link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure].

.Result

Cloud Compliance is enabled on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and it starts scanning the data in the working environment. Results will be available in the Compliance dashboard as soon as Cloud Compliance finishes the initial scans.

== Enabling Cloud Compliance on existing working environments

If you haven't enabled Cloud Compliance yet, enable it on existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files working environments from the *Scan Configuration* page in Cloud Manager.

Another option is to enable Cloud Compliance from the *Working Environments* tab by selecting each working environment individually.

.Steps for multiple working environments (first time only)

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Compliance* and then select the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_we_scan_config.png[A screenshot of the Scan Configuration tab immediately after deploying the Cloud Compliance instance.]

. To scan all volumes in a working environment, click *Activate Compliance for All Volumes*.
+
To scan only certain volumes in a working environment, click *or select Volumes* and then choose the volumes you want to scan.

See <<Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes,Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes>> for details.

.Steps for a single working environment

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Working Environments*.

. Select a working environment.

. In the pane on the right, click *Enable Compliance*.
+
image:screenshot_enable_compliance.gif[A screenshot that shows the Enable Compliance icon which is available in the Working Environments tab after you select a working environment.]

.Result

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the data on each working environment. Results will be available in the Compliance dashboard as soon as Cloud Compliance finishes the initial scans. The time that it takes depends on the amount of data--it could be a few minutes or hours.

== Verifying that Cloud Compliance has access to volumes

Make sure that Cloud Compliance can access volumes by checking your networking, security groups, and export policies. You'll need to provide Cloud Compliance with CIFS credentials so it can access CIFS volumes.

.Steps

. Make sure that there's a network connection between the Cloud Compliance instance and each network that includes volumes for Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files.
+
NOTE: For Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Compliance can only scan volumes that are in the same region as Cloud Manager.

. Ensure that the security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP allows inbound traffic from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
You can either open the security group for traffic from the IP address of the Cloud Compliance instance, or you can open the security group for all traffic from inside the virtual network.

. Ensure that NFS volume export policies include the IP address of the Cloud Compliance instance so it can access the data on each volume.

. If you use CIFS, provide Cloud Compliance with Active Directory credentials so it can scan CIFS volumes.

.. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Compliance*.

.. Click the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_cifs_credentials.gif[A screenshot of the Compliance tab that shows the Scan Status button that's available in the top right of the content pane.]

.. For each working environment, click *Edit CIFS Credentials* and enter the user name and password that Cloud Compliance needs to access CIFS volumes on the system.
+
The credentials can be read-only, but providing admin credentials ensures that Cloud Compliance can read any data that requires elevated permissions. The credentials are stored on the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
After you enter the credentials, you should see a message that all CIFS volumes were authenticated successfully.
+
image:screenshot_cifs_status.gif[A screenshot that shows the Scan Configuration page and one Cloud Volumes ONTAP system for which CIFS credentials were successfully provided.]

. On the *Scan Configuration* page, click *View Details* to review the status for each CIFS and NFS volume and correct any errors.
+
For example, the following image shows three volumes; one of which Cloud Compliance can't scan due to network connectivity issues between the Cloud Compliance instance and the volume.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_volume_details.gif[A screenshot of the View Details page in the scan configuration that shows three volumes; one of which isn't being scanned because of network connectivity between Cloud Compliance and the volume.]

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes

You can stop or start scanning volumes in a working environment at any time from the Scan Configuration page. We recommend that you scan all volumes.

image:screenshot_volume_compliance_selection.png[A screenshot of the scan configuration page where you can enable or disable scanning of individual volumes.]

[cols="40,50",options="header"]
|===
| To:
| Do this:

| Disable scanning for a volume | Move the volume slider to the left
| Disable scanning for all volumes | Move the *Activate Compliance for all Volumes* slider to the left
| Enable scanning for a volume | Move the volume slider to the right
| Enable scanning for all volumes | Move the *Activate Compliance for all Volumes* slider to the right

|===

TIP: New volumes added to the working environment are automatically scanned only when the *Activate Compliance for all Volumes* setting is enabled. When this setting is disabled, you'll need to activate scanning on each new volume you create in the working environment.

== Scanning data protection volumes

By default, data protection (DP) volumes are not scanned because they are not exposed externally and Cloud Compliance cannot access them. These volumes are typically the destination volumes for SnapMirror operations from an on-premises ONTAP cluster.

Initially, the Cloud Compliance volume list identifies these volumes as _Type_ *DP* with the _Status_ *Not Scanning* and the _Required Action_ *Enable Access to DP volumes*.

image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_dp_volumes.png[A screenshot showing the Enable Access to DP Volumes button that you can select to scan data protection volumes.]

.Steps

If you want to scan these data protection volumes:

. Click the *Enable Access to DP volumes* button at the top of the page.

. Activate each DP volume that you want to scan, or use the *Activate Compliance for all Volumes* control to enable all volumes, including all DP volumes.

Once enabled, Cloud Compliance creates an NFS share from each DP volume so that it can be scanned. The share export policies only allow access from the Cloud Compliance instance.
