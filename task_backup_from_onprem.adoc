Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from your on-premises ONTAP system to low-cost object storage in the cloud.

A Beta feature released in January 2021 allows you to run Compliance scans on the backed up volumes from your on-prem systems. Typically, compliance scans are free up to 1 TB of data, and then a cost for the service is applied for data over 1 TB. When combining Backup and Compliance for your on-prem volumes, the cost for scans on those on-prem volumes is free. Learn more about how link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Compliance^] can get your business applications and cloud environments privacy ready.

== Quick start

See link:task_restore_backups.html[Restoring volume data from backup files^] for details.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure you have a supported configuration before you start backing up on-prem volumes to object storage.

ONTAP requirements::
ONTAP 9.7P5 and later.
+
A SnapMirror license (included as part of the PREM or Data Protection bundle).

Cluster networking requirements::
An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-69120CF0-F188-434F-913E-33ACB8751A5D.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up Cloud Backup, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.

Supported regions::
Backups from on-prem systems are supported in all regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^].
+
* For Azure, you specify the region where the backups will be stored when you set up the service.
* For AWS, backups are stored in the region where Cloud Manager is installed.
// * For GCP, you specify the region where the backups will be stored when you set up the service.
+
*Note:* Backup to Google Cloud Storage from on-prem ONTAP systems is not currently supported from the UI.

License requirements::
// For Cloud Backup PAYGO licensing, you'll need a subscription to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Azure^], the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[AWS^], or the https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project&rif_reserved[Google^] Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering before you enable Cloud Backup. Billing for Cloud Backup is done through this subscription.
For Cloud Backup PAYGO licensing, you'll need a subscription to the https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Azure^] or the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[AWS^] Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering before you enable Cloud Backup. Billing for Cloud Backup is done through this subscription.
+
For Cloud Backup BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. See link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[Adding and updating your Backup BYOL license^].
+
And you need to have a subscription from your cloud provider for the object storage space where your backups will be located.

=== Preparing Amazon S3

When you are using Amazon S3, you must configure permissions for Cloud Manager to access the S3 bucket, and you must configure permissions so the on-prem ONTAP cluster can access the S3 bucket.

.Steps

. Provide the following S3 permissions (from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy^]) to the IAM role that provides Cloud Manager with permissions:
+
[source,json]
{
            "Sid": "backupPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:DeleteBucket",
                "s3:GetLifecycleConfiguration",
                "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration",
                "s3:PutBucketTagging",
                "s3:ListBucketVersions",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:GetBucketTagging",
                "s3:GetBucketLocation",
                "s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus",
                "s3:GetBucketPublicAccessBlock",
                "s3:GetBucketAcl",
                "s3:GetBucketPolicy",
                "s3:PutBucketPublicAccessBlock"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::netapp-backup-*"
            ]
        },

. Provide the following permissions to the IAM user so that the ONTAP cluster can back up data to S3.
+
[source,json]
"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
"s3:ListBucket",
"s3:GetBucketLocation",
"s3:GetObject",
"s3:PutObject",
"s3:DeleteObject"
+
See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-user.html[AWS Documentation: Creating a Role to Delegate Permissions to an IAM User^] for details.

. Create or locate an access key.
+
Cloud Backup passes the access key on to the ONTAP cluster. The credentials are not stored in the Cloud Backup service.
+
See the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[AWS Documentation: Managing Access Keys for IAM Users^] for details.
//
// === Preparing Google Cloud Storage
//
// When you set up backup, you need to provide storage access keys for a service account that has Storage Admin permissions. A service account enables Cloud Backup to authenticate and access Cloud Storage buckets used to store backups. The keys are required so that Google Cloud Storage knows who is making the request.
//
// .Steps
//
// . https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a service account that has the predefined Storage Admin role^].
//
// . Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^] and create access keys for the service account:
//
// .. Select a project, and click *Interoperability*. If you haven’t already done so, click *Enable interoperability access*.
//
// .. Under *Access keys for service accounts*, click *Create a key for a service account*, select the service account that you just created, and click *Create Key*.
// +
// You'll need to link:task_tiering_google.html#tiering-inactive-data-to-a-google-cloud-storage-bucket[enter the keys in Cloud Backup] later when you configure the backup service.

== Enabling Cloud Backup

Enable Cloud Backup at any time directly from the on-premises working environment.

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the working environment and click *Activate* next to the Backup & Compliance service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_from_onprem_activate.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup & Compliance Activate button which is available after you select an on-prem working environment.]

. Select the provider, and then enter the provider details:
- For Azure, enter:
.. The Azure subscription used for backups and the Azure region where the backups will be stored.
.. The resource group - you can create a new resource group or select and existing resource group.
.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_to_azure.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from an on-premises cluster to an Azure Blob tier.]
- For AWS, enter:
.. The AWS Access Key and Secret Key used to store the backups.
.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_to_aws.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from an on-premises cluster to an AWS S3 tier.]
// - For Google, enter:
// .. The Google Cloud Project where you want the Google Cloud Storage bucket to be created for backups. This can be a different Project than where Cloud Manager resides. (The Project must have a Service Account that has the predefined Storage Admin role.)
// .. The Google Access Key and Secret Key used to store the backups.
// .. The Google region where the backups will be stored. This can be a different region than where Cloud Manager resides.
// .. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside.
// +
//image:screenshot_backup_onprem_to_google.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from an on-premises cluster to a Google Cloud Storage bucket.]
+
Note that you cannot change this information after the service has started.

. Then click *Continue*.

. In the _Define Policy_ page, select the backup schedule and retention value and click *Continue*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_policy.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can choose your backup schedule and retention period.]
+
See link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#the-schedule-is-daily-weekly-monthly-or-a-combination[the list of existing policies^].

. Select the volumes that you want to back up.
+
* To back up all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_select_onprem_volumes.png[A screenshot of selecting the volumes that will be backed up.]

. Click *Activate* and Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of your volumes.
+
You are prompted whether you want to run compliance scans on the backed up volumes. Cloud Compliance scans are free when you run them on the backed up volumes (except for the link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#cost[cost of the deployed Cloud Compliance instance^]).
+
image:screenshot_compliance_on_backups.png[A screenshot of the page where you can choose to activate Cloud Compliance on your backed up volumes.]

. Click *Go to Compliance* to activate compliance scans on the volumes. (If you choose *Close* and not to scan these backed up volumes, you can always link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#scanning-backup-files-from-on-premises-ontap-systems[enable this functionality^] later from Cloud Compliance.)

* If an instance of Cloud Compliance is already deployed in your environment, you are directed to the Configuration page to select the volumes you want to scan in each on-premises working environment that has backups. See link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#enabling-cloud-compliance-in-your-working-environments[how to choose the volumes^].
+
image:screenshot_compliance_onprem_backups.png[A screenshot of the Compliance page to select volumes you want to scan.]
* If Cloud Compliance has not been deployed, you are directed to the Compliance page where you can choose to deploy Compliance in the cloud or in your premises. We strongly recommend deploying it in the cloud. Go link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[here^] for installation requirements and instructions.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_options.png[A screenshot of the Compliance page to choose how you want to deploy Cloud Compliance.]
+
After you have deployed Compliance you can choose the volumes you want to scan as described above.

.Result

Cloud Backup backs up your volumes from the on-prem ONTAP system, and optionally, Cloud Compliance runs compliance scans on the backed up volumes.

.What's next?

You can link:task_managing_backups.html[start and stop backups for volumes or change the backup schedule^] and you can link:task_restore_backups.html[restore entire volumes or individual files from a backup file^].

You can also link:task_controlling_private_data.html[view the results of the compliance scans^] and review other features of Cloud Compliance that can help you understand data context and identify sensitive data in your organization.

NOTE: The scan results are not available immediately because Cloud Backup has to finish creating the backups before Cloud Compliance can start compliance scans.
