Set up your Google Cloud Platform networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly.

Shared VPC::
Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP are supported in a Google Cloud Platform shared VPC.
+
Shared VPC enables you to configure and centrally manage virtual networks across multiple projects. You can set up Shared VPC networks in the _host project_ and deploy the Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP virtual machine instances in a _service project_. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/shared-vpc[Google Cloud documentation: Shared VPC overview^].

Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.
+
Routing and firewall policies must allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:
+
* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup

Firewall rules::
You don't need to create firewall rules because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to link:reference_firewall_rules_gcp.html[GCP firewall rules].

Connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Google Cloud Storage for data tiering::
If you want to tier cold data to a Google Cloud Storage bucket, the subnet in which Cloud Volumes ONTAP resides must be configured for Private Google Access. For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Google Cloud documentation: Configuring Private Google Access^].
+
For additional steps required to set up data tiering in Cloud Manager, see link:task_tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

Connections to ONTAP systems in other networks::
To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in GCP and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the VPC and the other networkâ€”for example, your corporate network.
+
For instructions, refer to https://cloud.google.com/vpn/docs/concepts/overview[Google Cloud documentation: Cloud VPN overview^].
