[.lead]
Cloud Compliance can scan your Amazon S3 buckets to identify the personal and sensitive data that resides in S3 object storage. Cloud Compliance can scan any bucket in the account, regardless if it was created for a NetApp solution.

== Pricing

Cloud Compliance for Amazon S3 is offered for no cost at this time. We'll notify you 30 days before the free trial is about to end. Pricing will be published at a later date.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Deploy Cloud Manager in AWS

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you haven't already done so, log in to https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central] and deploy Cloud Manager in AWS.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager must be running in the AWS account that has the S3 buckets that you want to scan. Cloud Manager automatically discovers the S3 buckets and displays them in an Amazon S3 working environment.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Set up your cloud environment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure that your cloud environment can meet the requirements for Cloud Compliance, which includes preparing an IAM role, setting up connectivity from Cloud Compliance to S3, and more. <<Reviewing prerequisites,See the complete list>>.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Enable Cloud Compliance

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the Amazon S3 working environment, click *Enable Compliance*, and select an IAM role that includes the required permissions.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Configure buckets

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the buckets that you'd like to scan and Cloud Compliance will start scanning them.

== Reviewing prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Compliance.

=== Requirements specific to S3

The first three requirements are specific to scanning S3 buckets.

[[policy-requirements]]
Ensure that Cloud Manager is in the same account as your S3 buckets::
Cloud Manager must be running in the AWS account that has the S3 buckets that you want to scan. Cloud Manager automatically discovers the S3 buckets and displays them in an Amazon S3 working environment.

Set up an IAM role for the Cloud Compliance instance::
Cloud Compliance needs permissions to connect to the S3 buckets in your account and to scan them. Set up an IAM role that includes the permissions listed below. Cloud Manager prompts you to select an IAM role when you enable Cloud Compliance on the Amazon S3 working environment.
+
[source,json]
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:Get*",
                "s3:List*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

NOTE: The AWS-managed policy _AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_ includes these required permissions.

Provide connectivity from Cloud Compliance to Amazon S3::
Cloud Compliance needs a connection to Amazon S3. The best way to provide that connection is through a VPC Endpoint to the S3 service. For instructions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-gateway.html#create-gateway-endpoint[AWS Documentation: Creating a Gateway Endpoint^].
+
When you create the VPC Endpoint, be sure to select the region, VPC, and route table that corresponds to the Cloud Compliance instance. You must also modify the security group to add an outbound HTTPS rule that enables traffic to the S3 endpoint. Otherwise, Cloud Compliance can't connect to the S3 service.
+
If you experience any issues, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/connect-s3-vpc-endpoint/[AWS Support Knowledge Center: Why can’t I connect to an S3 bucket using a gateway VPC endpoint?^]
+
An alternative is to provide the connection by using a NAT Gateway.
+
NOTE: You can't use a proxy to get to S3 over the internet.

=== General requirements

The remaining requirements apply to Cloud Compliance in general, whether you're scanning Amazon S3, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, or Azure NetApp Files. If you've already enabled Cloud Compliance for Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files, then you can skip these.

Enable outbound internet access::
Cloud Compliance requires outbound internet access. If your virtual network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the Cloud Compliance instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints. Note that Cloud Manager deploys the Cloud Compliance instance in the same subnet as Cloud Manager.

Ensure that Cloud Manager has the required permissions::
Ensure that Cloud Manager has permissions to deploy resources and create security groups for the Cloud Compliance instance. You can find the latest Cloud Manager permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP11022837.html[the policies provided by NetApp^].

Check your vCPU limits::
Ensure that your cloud provider's vCPU limit allows for the deployment of an instance with 16 cores. You'll need to verify the vCPU limit for the relevant instance family in the region where Cloud Manager is running.
+
In AWS, the instance family is _On-Demand Standard instances_. In Azure, the instance family is _Standard DSv3 Family_.
+
For more details on vCPU limits, see the following:
+
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[AWS documentation: Amazon EC2 Service Limits^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quotas[Azure documentation: Virtual machine vCPU quotas^]

Ensure that Cloud Manager can access Cloud Compliance::
Ensure connectivity between Cloud Manager and the Cloud Compliance instance:

* The security group for Cloud Manager must allow inbound and outbound traffic over port 80 to and from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
This connection enables deployment of the Cloud Compliance instance and enables you to view information in the Compliance tab.

* If your AWS network doesn’t use a NAT or proxy for internet access, modify the security group for Cloud Manager to allow inbound traffic over TCP port 3128 from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
This is required because the Cloud Compliance instance uses Cloud Manager as a proxy to access the internet.
+
NOTE: This port is open by default on all new Cloud Manager instances, starting with version 3.7.5. It's not open on Cloud Manager instances created prior to that.

Ensure that you can keep Cloud Compliance running::
The Cloud Compliance instance needs to stay on to continuously scan your data.

Ensure web browser connectivity to Cloud Compliance::
After Cloud Compliance is enabled, ensure that users access the Cloud Manager interface from a host that has a connection to the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
The Cloud Compliance instance uses a private IP address to ensure that the indexed data isn't accessible to the internet. As a result, the web browser that you use to access Cloud Manager must have a connection to that private IP address. That connection can come from a direct connection to AWS or Azure (for example, a VPN), or from a host that's inside the same network as the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
TIP: If you're accessing Cloud Manager from a public IP address, then your web browser probably isn't running on a host inside the network.

== Enabling Cloud Compliance

Enable Cloud Compliance on Amazon S3 after you verify the prerequisites.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Working Environments*.

. Select the Amazon S3 working environment.
+
image:screenshot_s3_we.gif[]

. In the pane on the right, click *Enable Compliance*.
+
image:screenshot_s3_enable_compliance.gif[]

. When prompted, assign an IAM role to the Cloud Compliance instance that has <<Requirements specific to S3,the required permissions>>.
+
image:screenshot_s3_compliance_iam_role.gif[]

. Click *Enable Compliance*.

.Result

If the Cloud Compliance instance hasn't been deployed yet, Cloud Manager deploys it. If it has been deployed, Cloud Manager assigns the IAM role to the instance.

== Configuring buckets

After Cloud Manager enables Cloud Compliance on Amazon S3, the next step is to configure the buckets that you want to scan.

.Steps

. Select the Amazon S3 working environment.

. In the pane on the right, click *Configure Buckets*.
+
image:screenshot_s3_configure_buckets.gif[]

. Select the buckets that you want to scan.
+
image:screenshot_s3_select_buckets.gif[]

.Result

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the S3 buckets that you selected. If there are any errors, they'll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error.
