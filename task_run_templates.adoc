Select one of the application templates that your organization has built to create volumes that are optimized for specific workloads and applications. Templates enable you to create volumes for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Azure NetApp Files, and on-premises ONTAP systems. They also enable you to activate link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup] and link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense] on the created volumes.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Before you can create a volume for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, or Azure NetApp Files system using a template, make sure you have access to an appropriate working environment where the volume will be deployed.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* If the template activates a cloud service on the volume, such as link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup^] or link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense^], ensure that the service is active and licensed in your environment.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Launch the Application Templates service

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the *AppTemplate* service and click the *Templates* tab.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Build the resource by running the template and defining parameters

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the template, click *Run Template*, and enter values in the editable fields to create the resource.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration.

* If you don't already have a Connector, link:concept_connectors.html[see how to create Connectors^] for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

* When creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume, make sure you have a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment available.

* When creating an on-premises ONTAP volume, make sure you have an on-premises ONTAP working environment available.

* When creating an Azure NetApp Files volume, make sure you have an Azure NetApp Files working environment available.

* If the template activates a cloud service on the volume, such as link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup^] or link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense^], ensure that the service is active and licensed in your environment.

== Selecting and running the template

There are multiple ways to select and run a template to create new volumes.

Regardless of the method you choose, the details about the required volume parameters that you must define are available in these sections:

* link:task_provisioning_storage.html#creating-volumes-from-templates[How to provision Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes^]
* link:task_manage_anf_volumes.html#creating-volumes-from-templates[How to provision Azure NetApp Files volumes^]
* link:task_provisioning_ontap.html#creating-volumes-from-templates[How to provision on-premises ONTAP volumes^]

=== Running a volume template from the working environment
