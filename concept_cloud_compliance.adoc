Cloud Compliance is a data privacy and compliance service for Cloud Manager that scans your volumes, Amazon S3 buckets, and databases to identify the personal and sensitive data that resides in those files. Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technology, Cloud Compliance helps organizations understand data context and identify sensitive data.

https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-compliance[Learn about the use cases for Cloud Compliance^].

== Features

Cloud Compliance provides several tools that can help you with your compliance efforts. You can use Cloud Compliance to:

* Identify Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
* Identify a wide scope of sensitive information as required by GDPR, CCPA, PCI, and HIPAA privacy regulations
* Respond to Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR)

== Supported working environments

Cloud Compliance can scan data from the following types of working environments:

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS and Azure
* Azure NetApp Files
* Amazon S3
* Databases that reside anywhere (no requirement to be in a working environment)

For Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Compliance can scan volumes that are in the same region as Cloud Manager. When you activate compliance scans on an Azure NetApp Files working environment, Cloud Compliance scans _all_ of the volumes in the region.

== Cost

The cost to use Cloud Compliance depends on the type of data that you're scanning. See https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-compliance#pricing[pricing^] for details.

Activating Cloud Compliance requires deploying a cloud instance, which results in charges from the cloud provider where it is deployed.

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files

Data transfer costs depend on your setup. If the Cloud Compliance instance and Cloud Volumes ONTAP are in the same Availability Zone and region, then there are no data transfer costs. But if Cloud Volumes ONTAP is in a _different_ Availability Zone or region, then you'll be charged by your cloud provider for data transfer costs. See these links for more details:

* https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/[AWS: Amazon EC2 Pricing^]
* https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/bandwidth/[Microsoft Azure: Bandwidth Pricing Details^]

=== Amazon S3

You need to pay to scan your Amazon S3 buckets. https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-compliance#pricing[Learn about pricing^].

A 30-day free trial is available to scan Amazon S3 data with Cloud Compliance. A subscription to the AWS Marketplace is required to continue scanning Amazon S3 after the free trial ends. link:task_scanning_s3.html#subscribing-to-aws-marketplace[Learn how to subscribe^].

=== Databases

You need to pay to scan your databases.


== How Cloud Compliance works

At a high-level, Cloud Compliance works like this:

. You deploy an instance of Cloud Compliance in Cloud Manager.
. You enable it on one or more working environments, or on your databases.
. Cloud Compliance scans the data using an AI learning process.
. In Cloud Manager, you click *Compliance* and use the provided dashboard and reporting tools to help in your compliance efforts.

== The Cloud Compliance instance

When you enable Cloud Compliance, Cloud Manager deploys a Cloud Compliance instance in the same subnet as the Connector. link:concept_connectors.html[Learn more about Connectors.^]

NOTE: If the Connector is installed on-prem, it deploys the Cloud Compliance instance in same VPC or VNet as the first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in the request.

image:diagram_cloud_compliance_instance.png[A diagram that shows a Cloud Manager instance and a Cloud Compliance instance running in your cloud provider.]

Note the following about the instance:

* In Azure, Cloud Compliance runs on a Standard_D16s_v3 VM with a 512 GB disk.

* In AWS, Cloud Compliance runs on an m5.4xlarge instance with a 500 GB GP2 disk.
+
In regions where m5.4xlarge isn't available, Cloud Compliance runs on an m4.4xlarge instance instead.
+
NOTE: Changing or resizing the instance/VM type isn't supported. You need to use the default size that's provided.

* The instance is named _CloudCompliance_ with a generated hash (UUID) concatenated to it. For example: _CloudCompliance-16bb6564-38ad-4080-9a92-36f5fd2f71c7_

* Only one Cloud Compliance instance is deployed per Connector.

* Upgrades of Cloud Compliance software is automated--you don't need to worry about it.

TIP: The instance should remain running at all times because Cloud Compliance continuously scans the data.

== How scans work

After you enable Cloud Compliance, it immediately starts scanning your data to identify personal and sensitive data.

Cloud Compliance connects to the data like any other client by mounting NFS and CIFS volumes. NFS volumes are automatically accessed as read-only, while you need to provide Active Directory credentials to scan CIFS volumes.

Cloud Compliance scans the unstructured data on each volume and the structured data in databases for a range of personal information. It maps your organizational data, categorizes each file, and identifies and extracts entities and predefined patterns in the data. The result of the scan is an index of personal information, sensitive personal information, and data categories.

After the initial scan, Cloud Compliance continuously scans each volume to detect incremental changes (this is why it's important to keep the instance running).

You can turn scans on and off at the working environment level link:task_managing_compliance.html#deactivating-compliance-scans-for-a-working-environment[learn how], at the volume level link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#enabling-and-disabling-compliance-scans-on-individual-volumes[learn how], at the bucket level link:task/scanning_s3.html#configuring-buckets[learn how], and at the database schema level.

== Information that Cloud Compliance indexes

Cloud Compliance collects, indexes, and assigns categories to unstructured data (files). The data that Cloud Compliance indexes includes the following:

Standard metadata:: Cloud Compliance collects standard metadata about files: the file type, its size, creation and modification dates, and so on.

Personal data:: Personally identifiable information such as email addresses, identification numbers, or credit card numbers. link:task_controlling_private_data.html#personal-data[Learn more about personal data].

Sensitive personal data:: Special types of sensitive information, such as health data, ethnic origin, or political opinions, as defined by GDPR and other privacy regulations. link:task_controlling_private_data.html#sensitive-personal-data[Learn more about sensitive personal data].

Categories:: Cloud Compliance takes the data that it scanned and divides it into different types of categories. Categories are topics based on AI analysis of the content and metadata of each file. link:task_controlling_private_data.html#categories[Learn more about categories].

Name entity recognition::
Cloud Compliance uses AI to extract natural personsâ€™ names from documents. link:task_responding_to_dsar.html[Learn about responding to Data Subject Access Requests].

== Networking overview

Cloud Manager deploys the Cloud Compliance instance with a security group that enables inbound HTTP connections from the Connector instance.

Outbound rules are completely open. The instance connects to the internet through a proxy from Cloud Manager. Internet access is needed to upgrade the Cloud Compliance software and to send usage metrics.

If you have strict networking requirements, link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#reviewing-prerequisites[learn about the endpoints that Cloud Compliance contacts].

== User access to compliance information

Cloud Manager Admins can view compliance information for all working environments.

Workspace Admins can view compliance information only for systems that they have permissions to access. If a Workspace Admin can't access a working environment in Cloud Manager, then they can't see any compliance information for the working environment in the Compliance tab.
