* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<Backup to Cloud enhancements>>
* <<Active IQ cluster insights>>

=== Azure Private Link for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

By default, Cloud Manager now enables an Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts. A Private Link secures connections between endpoints in Azure. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview[Learn more^].

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When you set up data tiering from your volumes, Cloud Tiering now identifies the Snapshot used size for each volume. This information can help you decide which type of data to tier to the cloud.
+

* Cloud Tiering now enables inactive data reporting on HDD aggregates, if the cluster is running ONTAP 9.6 or later.
+
This enhancement makes it easier for Cloud Tiering to show you the potential savings from tiering cold data.

* Cloud Tiering now prompts you to change thick-provisioned volumes to thin-provisioned volumes, if that's required to enable data tiering on the volumes in an aggregate.

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* Ability to easily scan CIFS data protection volumes
+
Scanning NFS DP volumes that reside on your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems was available in an earlier release. This release allows you to easily scan CIFS DP volumes directly within Cloud Compliance. link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#scanning-data-protection-volumes[Learn how].

* Now you can create custom personal data identifiers from your databases
+
A feature we call "Data Fusion" allows you to scan your files to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in those files--basically making your own list of "personal data" that is identified in Cloud Compliance scans. You choose the identifiers by selecting columns in your databases. This gives you the full picture about where potentially sensitive data resides in all your files.

* Added support for scanning MySQL database schemas.
+
Go to link:task_scanning_databases.html[scanning database schemas] for the list of all supported databases and for instructions.

=== Active IQ cluster insights

Active IQ cluster insights are now available within Cloud Manager. This initial release provides the following functionality:

* Shows a list of your on-prem clusters based on your NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials.
* Identifies which of those clusters have been discovered within Cloud Manager, and those that have not been discovered.
* Enables you to add undiscovered clusters into Cloud Manager.
* Identifies if any of your discovered ONTAP clusters need to have their shelf or disk firmware updated.
* Enables you to download the firmware zip file so you can update the firmware on the cluster.
