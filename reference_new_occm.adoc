== Cloud Manager 3.9.6 (2 May 2021)

* <<Cloud Backup & Restore enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>
* <<Monitoring enhancements>>
* <<Replication enhancement>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<Application Template enhancement>>
* <<Account enhancement>>

=== Cloud Backup & Restore enhancements

* The separate Backup and Restore Dashboards have been combined under a new *Backup & Restore* tab to make it easier for you to manage all your backup and restore operations from a single location. See link:task_managing_backups.html#viewing-the-volumes-that-are-being-backed-up[the Backup & Restore Dashboard^] for details.

* Now you can create backups from your on-premises ONTAP systems to Google Cloud Storage or to your NetApp StorageGRID systems. See link:task_backup_from_onprem.html[Backing up to Google Cloud Storage^] and link:task_backup_onprem_private_cloud.html[Backing up to StorageGRID^] for details.

* Backup policies have been improved with the following enhancements:

** Now you create a custom policy that includes a combination of daily, weekly, and monthly backups.
** When you change a backup policy, the change applies to all new backups *and* to all volumes using the original backup policy. In the past the change only applied to new volume backups.

* Some smaller improvements have also been made:

** When configuring the cloud destination for your backup files, now you can select a different region than the region in which the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
** The number of backup files you can create for a single volume has been increased from 1,019 to 4,000.
** In addition to the earlier ability to delete all backup files for a single volume, now you can delete just a single backup file for a volume, or you can delete all backup files for an entire working environment, if needed.

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* You can now view the errors found in reports and you can delete the last report or all reports.
+
link:task_sync_managing_reports.html[Learn more about creating and viewing reports to tune your configuration].

* A new *Compare by* setting is now available for each sync relationship.
+
This advanced setting enables you to choose whether Cloud Sync should compare certain attributes when determining whether a file or directory has changed and should be synced again.
+
link:task_sync_managing_relationships.html#changing-the-settings-for-a-sync-relationship[Learn more about changing the settings for a sync relationship].

=== Monitoring enhancements

* You can now enable the Monitoring service on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment even if you have an existing Cloud Insights tenant.

* When you enable the Monitoring service, Cloud Manager sets up a free trial of Cloud Insights. On the 29th day, your plan now automatically transitions from the Trial Version to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#editions[Basic Edition^].

link:concept_monitoring.html[Learn more about using the Monitoring service with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== Replication enhancement

We redesigned the Replication tab for ease of use and to match the current look and feel of the Cloud Manager user interface.

image:replication.gif[A screenshot of the redesigned Replication tab in Cloud Manager that shows a list of volume relationships.]

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When selecting the volumes that you want to tier from an ONTAP system, now there's a checkbox in the Tier Volumes page to select *all* volumes to make it easier to apply the same policy to all volumes.

* If you need to change the number of "cooling days" that determine how long data in a volume must remain inactive before it is moved to object storage, now you can specify up to 183 days (up from 63 days) when using ONTAP 9.8 or greater.

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* Scanning of data stored on Azure Blob is now supported when using the https://min.io/[MinIO service]. See link:task_scanning_object_storage.html[Scanning object storage that uses S3 protocol^] for details.

* New personal data type. Cloud Compliance can now find Austrian SSNs in files.

=== Application Template enhancement

The user interface has been enhanced in the AppTemplates service so that it is easier for template designers to move between actions and to see which action they are currently defining.

=== Account enhancement

The Timeline in Cloud Manager now shows actions and events related to account management. The actions include things like associating users, creating workspaces, and creating Connectors. Checking the Timeline can be helpful if you need to identify who performed a specific action, or if you need to identify the status of an action.

link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html[Learn how to filter the Timeline to the Tenancy service].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.5 (11 Apr 2021)

* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<New Application Templates feature>>
* <<Connector enhancement>>
* <<Account enhancements>>

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager includes enhancements to the management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Enhancement available in all cloud providers

Cloud Manager now enables logical space reporting on the initial storage VM that it creates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

When space is reported logically, ONTAP reports the volume space such that all the physical space saved by the storage efficiency features are also reported as used.

==== Enhancements available in AWS

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports _General Purpose SSD (gp3)_ disks, starting with the 9.7 release. gp3 disks are the lowest-cost SSDs that balance cost and performance for a broad range of workloads.
+
link:task_planning_your_config.html#sizing-your-system-in-aws[Learn more about using gp3 disks with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP no longer supports Cold HDD (sc1) disks.

==== Enhancement available in Azure

When Cloud Manager creates storage accounts in Azure for Cloud Volumes ONTAP, the TLS version for the storage account is now version 1.2.

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* The standalone Cloud Sync service has been retired. You should now access Cloud Sync directly from Cloud Manager where all of the same features and functionality are available.
+
After logging in to Cloud Manager, you can switch to the Sync tab at the top and view your relationships, just like before.

* When setting up a sync relationship, you can choose from Google Cloud buckets in different projects, if you provide the required permissions to the data broker's service account.
+
link:task_sync_installing_gcp.html[Learn how to set up the service account].

* Cloud Sync now copies metadata between Google Cloud Storage and S3 providers (AWS S3, StorageGRID, and IBM Cloud Object Storage).

* You can now restart a data broker from Cloud Sync.
+
image:screenshot_sync_restart_data_broker.gif[A screenshot that shows the Restart Data Broker action from the Manage Data Brokers page.]

* Cloud Sync now identifies when a data broker isn't running the latest software release. This message can help to ensure that you're getting the latest features and functionalities.
+
image:screenshot_sync_warning.gif[A screenshot that shows a warning when viewing a data broker on the Dashboard.]

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* Added support for scanning NFS or CIFS file shares that reside on-premises or in the cloud.
+
Now you can scan file shares that reside on non-NetApp storage systems. See link:task_scanning_file_shares.html[scanning file shares^] for details.

* Added support for scanning object storage that uses the S3 protocol.
+
In addition to scanning Amazon S3 buckets, now you can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the S3 protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, and more. See link:task_scanning_object_storage.html[scanning object storage^] for details.

* The feature called "Highlights" has been renamed to "Policies". See link:task_managing_highlights.html#controlling-your-data-using-policies[how to use Policies] to help in your compliance and governance efforts.

* Now you can see if there are duplicates of certain files in your storage systems. This is useful to identify areas where you can save storage space. It can also help to ensure that files containing sensitive information are not unnecessarily duplicated in your storage systems.
+
Learn how to link:task_controlling_private_data.html#viewing-whether-files-are-duplicated-in-your-storage-systems[search for duplicate files].

* The link:task_controlling_governance_data.html[Governance dashboard^] has added charts to show link:task_controlling_governance_data.html#top-data-repositories-listed-by-data-sensitivity[top data repositories listed by data sensitivity] and link:task_controlling_governance_data.html#data-listed-by-types-of-open-permissions[data listed by types of Open Permissions].

=== New Application Templates feature

Templates enable you to standardize resource creation in your working environments. For example, you can hard-code required parameters in a "volume template" that are later applied when a storage admin creates a volume. This can include required disk type, size, protocol, cloud provider, and more. You can also turn on certain services, like Cloud Backup, for every created volume.

This makes it easy for your storage admins to create volumes that are optimized for specialized workload requirements; such as databases or streaming services. And it makes life easier for your storage architects knowing that each volume is created optimally for each application. Learn about link:concept_resource_templates.html[Application Templates^] and how you can use them in your environment.

=== Connector enhancement

If you configured a proxy server, you can now enable an option to send API calls directly to Cloud Manager without going through the proxy. This option is supported with Connectors that are running in AWS or in Google Cloud.

link:task_configuring_proxy.html[Learn more about this setting].

=== Account enhancements

* You can now create a service account user.
+
A service account acts as a "user" that can make authorized API calls to Cloud Manager for automation purposes. This makes it easier to manage automation because you don't need to build automation scripts based on a real person's user account who can leave the company at any time. And if you're using federation, you can create a token without generating a refresh token from the cloud.
+
link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html#creating-and-managing-service-accounts[Learn more about using service accounts].

* You can now allow private previews in your account to get access to new NetApp cloud services as they are made available as a preview in Cloud Manager.

* You can also allow third-party services in your account to get access to third-party services that are available in Cloud Manager.

link:task_managing_cloud_central_accounts.html#allowing-private-previews[Learn more about these options].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.4 update (8 Apr 2021)

=== Active IQ enhancements

* If Active IQ discovers unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses in your account, you can click a button to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using the license. Or you can apply the license to an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to extend the capacity of that license by 368 TB.
+
See link:task_managing_ontap.html#using-unused-cloud-volumes-ontap-licenses[how to use your available licenses^].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.4 update (15 Mar 2021)

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* A new link:task_controlling_governance_data.html[Governance dashboard^] is now available so that you can increase the efficiency and control the costs related to the data on your organizations' storage resources.
+
For example, the dashboard identifies the amount of stale data, non-business data, and very large files in your systems so you can decide whether you want to move, delete, or tier some files to less expensive object storage.

* You can view a list of link:task_controlling_private_data.html#viewing-file-metadata[all users or groups who have access to a file^].

* Cloud Compliance is now supported in Government regions in AWS.

== Cloud Manager 3.9.4 (8 Mar 2021)

* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements>>
* <<Connector enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>

+
link:task_getting_started_aws_c2s.html[Learn how to get started in C2S].

* Cloud Manager has always enabled you to encrypt Cloud Volumes ONTAP data using the AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Starting with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.9.0, data on EBS disks and data tiered to S3 are encrypted if you select a customer-managed CMK. Previously, only EBS data would be encrypted.
+
Note that you'll need to provide the Cloud Volumes ONTAP IAM role with access to use the CMK.
+
link:task_setting_up_kms.html[Learn more about setting up the AWS KMS with Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

==== Enhancement available in Azure

You can now deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 in the Azure Department of Defense (DoD) Impact Level 6 (IL6).

==== Enhancements available in Google Cloud

* We've reduced the number of IP addresses that are required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 and later in Google Cloud. By default, one less IP address is required (we unified the intercluster LIF with the node management LIF). You also have the option to skip the creation of the SVM management LIF when using the API, which would reduce the need for an additional IP address.
+
link:reference_networking_gcp.html#requirements-for-cloud-volumes-ontap[Learn more about IP address requirements in Google Cloud].

* When you deploy a Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pair in Google Cloud, you can now choose shared VPCs for VPC-1, VPC-2, and VPC-3. Previously, only VPC-0 could be a shared VPC. This change is supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.8 and later.
+
link:reference_networking_gcp.html[Learn more about Google Cloud networking requirements].

=== Connector enhancements

* Cloud Manager now notifies Admin users through an email when a Connector isn't running.
+
Keeping your Connectors up and running helps to ensure the best management of Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other NetApp Cloud Services.

* Cloud Manager now displays a notification if you need to change the instance type for your Connector.
+
Changing the instance type ensures that you can use the new features and capabilities that you're currently missing. link:reference_key_changes.html#machine-type-changes[Learn more about machine type changes].

=== Cloud Sync enhancements

* Cloud Sync now supports sync relationships between ONTAP S3 Storage and SMB servers:
** ONTAP S3 Storage to an SMB server
** An SMB server to ONTAP S3 Storage
+
link:reference_sync_requirements.html[View supported sync relationships].

* Cloud Sync now enables you to unify a data broker group's configuration directly from the user interface.
+
We don't recommend changing the configuration on your own. You should consult with NetApp to understand when to change the configuration and how to change it.
+
link:task_sync_managing_data_brokers.html[Learn more about defining a unified configuration].

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When tiering to Google Cloud Storage, you can apply a lifecycle rule so that the tiered data transitions from the Standard storage class to lower-cost Nearline, Coldline, or Archive storage after 30 days.

* Cloud Tiering now displays if you have any undiscovered on-prem ONTAP clusters so that you can add them to Cloud Manager to enable tiering or other services on those clusters.
+
link:task_managing_tiering.html#discovering-additional-clusters-from-cloud-tiering[Learn how to discover these additional clusters^].

=== Active IQ enhancements

* When Active IQ displays the list of your on-prem clusters (based on your NSS account), you can click a button to link:task_discovering_ontap.html#discovering-clusters-from-the-active-iq-page[discover the cluster^] and add it to the Cloud Manager Canvas. This makes it easier to manage all your storage systems from Cloud Manager.

* When Active IQ determines that one or more clusters require firmware updates, you can click a button to link:task_managing_ontap.html#downloading-new-disk-and-shelf-firmware[download the Ansible playbook and upgrade the cluster firmware^].

* A new link:task_managing_ontap.html#viewing-on-prem-workloads-that-are-candidates-for-the-cloud[Cloud-Ready Workloads tab^] provides a list of the workloads or volumes that we have identified as ideal to move to the cloud from your on-prem ONTAP clusters. Moving some of these volumes could reduce your costs and improve performance and resiliency.
+
See link:https://www.netapp.com/knowledge-center/what-is-lift-and-shift[What is Lift and Shift?]

=== ANF enhancements

* Now you can dynamically change the service level for a volume to meet workload needs and optimize your costs. The volume is moved to the other capacity pool with no impact to the volume. link:task_manage_anf_volumes.html#changing-the-volumes-service-level[Learn more^].

== Cloud Manager 3.9.3 update (16 Feb 2021)

=== Cloud Backup Service enhancements

* Now you can restore volumes to on-premises ONTAP systems from backup files that reside in Amazon S3, Azure Blob, and Google Cloud Storage.

* A new Restore Dashboard has been added that provides details about all the volumes and files you have restored.
+
The Dashboard is also the starting place to perform all volume and file restore operations. See link:task_restore_backups.html#the-restore-dashboard[the Restore Dashboard^] for details. In previous releases the restore volumes option was included in the Backup Dashboard.

* Cloud Backup is now supported on Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA systems in Google Cloud.

== Cloud Manager 3.9.3 update (14 Feb 2021)

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* View and manage Azure Information Protection (AIP) labels in files you are scanning.

** After you integrate the AIP label functionality into Cloud Compliance, you can view the labels that are assigned to files, add labels to files, and change labels. See link:task_managing_highlights.html#categorizing-your-data-using-aip-labels[how to integrate AIP labels^] in your workspace.
** Assign labels individually to files, or use the Policies functionality to link:task_managing_highlights.html#assigning-aip-labels-automatically-with-policies[add labels to all files that match the Policy criteria^]. With Policies, labels are updated continuously as Cloud Compliance finds matches in your files.
** Filter data in the Investigation page by AIP label to view all files that match the label.

* Send email alerts to Cloud Manager users (daily, weekly, or monthly) when any of your Policies return results so you can get notifications to protect your data.
+

== Cloud Manager 3.9.2 (4 Jan 2021)

* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<General enhancements>>

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP enhancements

This release of Cloud Manager introduces the following enhancements for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

==== Support for AWS Outposts

A few months ago, we announced that Cloud Volumes ONTAP had achieved the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Outposts Ready designation. Today, we're pleased to announce that we've validated Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP with AWS Outposts.

If you have an AWS Outpost, you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in that Outpost by selecting the Outpost VPC in the Working Environment wizard. The experience is the same as any other VPC that resides in AWS. Note that you will need to first deploy a Connector in your AWS Outpost.

There are a few limitations to point out:

* Only single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems are supported at this time
* The EC2 instances that you can use with Cloud Volumes ONTAP are limited to what's available in your Outpost
* Only General Purpose SSDs (gp2) are supported at this time

==== Support for Ultra SSD VNVRAM in all supported Azure regions

Cloud Volumes ONTAP can now use an Ultra SSD as VNVRAM when you use the E32s_v3 VM type with a single node system https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd[in any supported Azure region^].

VNVRAM provides better write performance.

==== Ability to choose an Availability Zone in Azure

You can now choose the Availability Zone in which you'd like to deploy a single node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. If you don't select an AZ, Cloud Manager will select one for you.

image:screenshot_azure_az.gif[A screenshot of the Availability Zone drop-down list that's available after choosing a region.]

==== Support for bigger disks and new instances in GCP

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports 64 TB disks in GCP.
+
NOTE: The maximum system capacity with disks alone remains at 256 TB due to GCP limits.

* Cloud Volumes ONTAP now supports the following machine types:
** n2-standard-4 with the Explore license and with BYOL
** n2-standard-8 with the Standard license and with BYOL
** n2-standard-32 with the Premium license and with BYOL

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* A new Cloud Performance Test gives you the ability to measure network latency and throughput performance from an ONTAP cluster to an object store before and after setting up data tiering.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_performance_test.gif[A screenshot of the Cloud Performance Test results that shows the latency and throughput to object storage.]

* The Tiering Setup wizards were redesigned for ease of use.

=== Additional enhancements

* New Support Dashboard
+
In the Help menu, a new Support Dashboard includes links to resources that can enable you to get help, submit feedback, and contact NetApp Support. You can also send and download AutoSupport messages from the *Connector AutoSupport* tab.
+
image:screenshot_support_dashboard.gif[A screenshot of the Support Dashboard in Cloud Manager.]

* Visual representation between working environments
+
Cloud Manager makes it easier to view the relationships between the services enabled on your working environments.
+
For example, the following image shows an example of two working environments where data is backed up from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Amazon S3, and where data is synced between Amazon S3 and two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.
+
image:screenshot_we_relationships.png[A screenshot that shows the Canvas tab and several relationships between working environments which are depicted by lines and arrows.]

== Cloud Manager 3.9.1 (7 Dec 2020)

* <<General enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Volumes ONTAP AMI change>>
* <<Cloud Backup enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Sync enhancements>>

=== General enhancements

* We've renamed the *Working Environments* tab to *Canvas*.
+
This tab starts as a blank canvas and enables you to add your working environments by deploying, allocating, and discovering storage across your hybrid cloud.
+
image:screenshot_canvas.gif[A screenshot of the Canvas tab showing several types of working environments.]

* It's now easier to navigate between Cloud Manager and Spot.
+
A new *Storage Operations* section in Spot enables you to navigate directly to Cloud Manager. After you're done, you can get back to Spot from the *Compute* tab in Cloud Manager.

=== Cloud Volumes ONTAP AMI change

Starting with the 9.8 release, the Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO AMI is no longer available in the AWS Marketplace. If you use the Cloud Manager API to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO, you'll need to https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[subscribe to the Cloud Manager subscription in the AWS Marketplace^] before deploying a 9.8 system.

=== Cloud Backup enhancements

* You now have the ability to restore individual files from a backup file.
- If you need to restore a few files from a certain point in time, now you can just restore those files instead of having to restore the whole volume.
- You can restore the files to a volume in the same working environment, or to a volume in a different working environment that’s using the same cloud account.
- This single file restore option relies on a new Cloud Restore instance that is deployed in your environment. link:task_restore_backups.html#restoring-files-from-a-backup[Go here for details about this new functionality.]

* You can configure Cloud Backup in a Google Cloud environment now while deploying a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. In the past you could only configure Cloud Backup on existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

* Now you can restore volumes that you had backed up from on-prem ONTAP systems to Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems deployed in AWS or Azure.

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

* Ability to scan data directly from your on-premises ONTAP clusters
+
If you have discovered your on-prem clusters in Cloud Manager, now you can run Compliance scans directly on those volumes. No longer do you have to copy those volumes to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system before you can run a Compliance scan.

* Ability to install Cloud Compliance in your on-premises location
+
If you plan to scan on-premises ONTAP cluster data, now you can install Cloud Compliance on-premises as well. It is still integrated in the Cloud Manager UI and it can still be used to scan other working environments, including cloud based volumes, buckets, and databases.
+
link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html#deploying-the-cloud-compliance-instance-on-premises[See the prerequisites and installation steps here].

* Ability to easily scan CIFS data protection volumes
+
In the past you have been able to scan NFS DP volumes. This release allows you to easily scan CIFS DP volumes directly within Cloud Compliance. link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#scanning-data-protection-volumes[Learn how].

* A new "Policies" feature provides a predefined selection of combination filters that return results in the Investigation page
+
Ten Policies are available with this release. For example, the "HIPAA – Stale data over 30 days" Policy identifies files that contain Health information that is over 30 days old. link:task_controlling_private_data.html#using-policies-to-quickly-view-results-in-the-investigation-page[See the full list of predefined policies].
+

== Cloud Manager 3.9 update (8 Nov 2020)

We released an enhancement to Cloud Manager 3.9.

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

*	Now you can create custom personal data identifiers from your databases. This gives you the full picture about where potentially sensitive data resides in *all* your files.
+
A feature we call "Data Fusion" allows you to scan your files to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in those files—basically making your own list of "personal data" that is identified in Cloud Compliance scans.
+
link:task_controlling_private_data.html#creating-custom-personal-data-identifiers-from-your-databases[Learn how to create custom personal identifiers from your databases].

*	Added support for scanning MySQL database schemas.
+
Go to link:task_scanning_databases.html#quick-start[scanning database schemas] for the list of all supported databases and for instructions.

== Cloud Manager 3.9 (3 Nov 2020)

* <<Azure Private Link for Cloud Volumes ONTAP>>
* <<Active IQ cluster insights>>
* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>

=== Azure Private Link for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

By default, Cloud Manager now enables an Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts. A Private Link secures connections between endpoints in Azure.

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview[Learn more about Azure Private Links^]
* link:task_enabling_private_link.html[Learn more about using an Azure Private Link with Cloud Volumes ONTAP]

=== Active IQ cluster insights

Active IQ cluster insights are now available within Cloud Manager. This initial release provides the following functionality:

* Shows a list of your on-prem clusters based on your NetApp Support Site (NSS) credentials.
* Identifies which of those clusters have been discovered within Cloud Manager, and those that have not been discovered.
* Enables you to view unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses.
* Identifies if any of your discovered ONTAP clusters need to have their shelf or disk firmware updated.

Go to link:task_managing_ontap.html[Monitoring ONTAP clusters] for details. This information is provided to Cloud Manager from the link:https://www.netapp.com/services/support/active-iq/[Active IQ Digital Advisor^].

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When you set up data tiering from your volumes, Cloud Tiering now identifies the Snapshot used size for each volume. This information can help you decide which type of data to tier to the cloud.
+
image:screenshot_volumes_select_snapshot.gif[A screenshot that shows the Snapshot used size in the Tier Volumes page.]

* Cloud Tiering now enables inactive data reporting on HDD aggregates, if the cluster is running ONTAP 9.6 or later.
+
This enhancement makes it easier for Cloud Tiering to show you the potential savings from tiering cold data.

* Cloud Tiering now prompts you to change thick-provisioned volumes to thin-provisioned volumes, if that's required to enable data tiering on the volumes in an aggregate.
