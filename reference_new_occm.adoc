== Cloud Manager 3.6.3 (4 Feb 2019)

Cloud Manager 3.6.3 includes the following enhancements.

* <<Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 GA>>
* <<368 TB capacity limit for all Premium and BYOL configurations>>
* <<Support for new AWS regions>>
* <<Support for S3 Intelligent-Tiering>>
* <<Ability to disable data tiering on the initial aggregate>>
* <<EC2 instance type now t3.medium for Cloud Manager>>
* <<Postponement of scheduled shutdowns during data transfers>>

=== Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 GA

Cloud Manager now supports the General Availability (GA) release of Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5. This includes support for M5 and R5 instances in AWS. For more details about the 9.5 release, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_new_95.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 Release Notes^].

=== 368 TB capacity limit for all Premium and BYOL configurations

The system capacity limit for Cloud Volumes ONTAP Premium and BYOL is now 368 TB across all configurations: single node and HA in both AWS and Azure. This change applies to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5, 9.4, and 9.3 (AWS only with 9.3).

For some configurations, disk limits prevent you from reaching the 368 TB capacity limit by using disks alone. In those cases, you can reach the 368 TB capacity limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/concept_data_tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^]. For example, a single node system in Azure could have 252 TB of disk-based capacity, which would allow up to 116 TB of inactive data in Azure Blob storage.

For information about disk limits, refer to storage limits in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^].

=== Support for new AWS regions

Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP are now supported in the following AWS regions:

* Europe (Stockholm)
+
Single node systems only. HA pairs are not supported at this time.
* GovCloud (US-East)
+
This is in addition to support for the AWS GovCloud (US-West) region.

https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[See the full list of supported regions^].

=== Support for S3 Intelligent-Tiering

When you enable data tiering in AWS, Cloud Volumes ONTAP tiers inactive data to the S3 Standard storage class by default. You can now change the tiering level to the _Intelligent Tiering_ storage class. This storage class optimizes storage costs by moving data between two tiers as data access patterns change. One tier is for frequent access and the other is for infrequent access.

Just like in previous releases, you can also use the Standard-Infrequent Access tier and the One Zone-Infrequent Access tier.

link:concept_data_tiering.html[Learn more about data tiering] and http://localhost:4001/occm/us-en/task_tiering.html#changing-the-tiering-level[learn how to change the storage class].

=== Ability to disable data tiering on the initial aggregate

In previous releases, Cloud Manager automatically enabled data tiering on the initial Cloud Volumes ONTAP aggregate. You can now choose to disable data tiering on this initial aggregate. (You can enable or disable data tiering on subsequent aggregates, as well.)

This new option is available when choosing the underlying storage resources. The following image shows an example when launching a system in AWS:

image:screenshot_s3_tiering_initial_aggr.gif[A screenshot that shows the S3 Tiering Edit option when choosing an underlying disk.]

=== EC2 instance type now t3.medium for Cloud Manager

The instance type for Cloud Manager is now t3.medium when deploying Cloud Manager in AWS from NetApp Cloud Central or from the AWS Marketplace. This change enables support in the latest AWS regions and reduces instance costs. The instance type was previously t2.medium.

=== Postponement of scheduled shutdowns during data transfers

If you scheduled an automatic shutdown of your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, Cloud Manager now postpones the shutdown if an active data transfer is in progress. Cloud Manager shuts down the system after the transfer is complete.

== Cloud Manager 3.6.2 (2 Jan 2019)

Cloud Manager 3.6.2 includes new features and enhancements.

* <<AWS spread placement group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA in a single AZ>>
* <<Ransomware protection>>
* <<New data replication policies>>
* <<Volume access control for Kubernetes>>

=== AWS spread placement group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA in a single AZ

When you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA in a single AWS Availability Zone, Cloud Manager now launches the two HA nodes and the mediator in an https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/placement-groups.html[AWS spread placement group^]. The placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures by spreading the instances across distinct underlying hardware.

NOTE: This feature improves redundancy from a compute perspective and not from disk failure perspective.

Cloud Manager requires new permissions for this feature. Ensure that the IAM policy that provides Cloud Manager with permissions includes the following actions:

[source,json]
"ec2:CreatePlacement",
"ec2:DeletePlacementGroup"

You can find the entire list of required permissions in the https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.6.2.json[latest AWS policy for Cloud Manager^].

=== Ransomware protection

Ransomware attacks can cost a business time, resources, and reputation. Cloud Manager now enables you to implement the NetApp solution for ransomware, which provides effective tools for visibility, detection, and remediation.

* Cloud Manager identifies volumes that are not protected by a Snapshot policy and enables you to activate the default Snapshot policy on those volumes.
+
Snapshot copies are read-only, which prevents ransomware corruption. They can also provide the granularity to create images of a single file copy or a complete disaster recovery solution.

* Cloud Manager also enables you to block common ransomware file extensions by enabling ONTAP's FPolicy solution.

image:screenshot_ransomware_protection.gif[A screenshot that shows the Ransomware Protection page that is available from within a working environment. The screen shows the number of volumes without a Snapshot Policy and the ability to block ransomware file extensions.]

link:task_protecting_ransomware.html[Learn how to implement the NetApp solution for ransomware].

=== New data replication policies

Cloud Manager includes five new data replication policies that you can use for data protection.

Three of the policies configure disaster recovery and long-term retention of backups on the same destination volume. Each policy provides a different backup retention period:

* Mirror and Backup (7 year retention)
* Mirror and Backup (7 year retention with more weekly backups)
* Mirror and Backup (1 year retention, monthly)

The remaining policies provide more options for long-term retention of backups:

* Backup (1 month retention)
* Backup (1 week retention)

Simply drag-and-drop a working environment to select one of the new policies.

=== Volume access control for Kubernetes

You can now configure the export policy for Kubernetes Persistent Volumes. The export policy can enable access to clients if the Kubernetes cluster is in a different network than the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

You can configure the export policy when you connect a working environment to a Kubernetes cluster and by editing an existing volume.

== Cloud Manager 3.6.1 (4 Dec 2018)

Cloud Manager 3.6.1 includes new features and enhancements.

* <<Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 in Azure>>
* <<Cloud Provider Accounts>>
* <<Enhancements to the AWS Cost report>>
* <<Support for new Azure regions>>

=== Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 in Azure

Cloud Manager now supports the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 release in Microsoft Azure, which includes a preview of high-availability (HA) pairs. You can request a preview license for an Azure HA pair by contacting us at ng-Cloud-Volume-ONTAP-preview@netapp.com.

For more details about the 9.5 release, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_new_95.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 Release Notes^].

==== New Azure permissions required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5

Cloud Manager requires new Azure permissions for key features in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 release. To ensure that Cloud Manager can deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 systems, you should update your Cloud Manager policy by adding the following permissions:

[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/write",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/delete",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools/join/action",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/frontendIPConfigurations/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/loadBalancingRules/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/probes/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/probes/join/action",
"Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action"
"Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write",
"Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write",
"Microsoft.Web/sites/*"
"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete",
"Microsoft.Storage/usages/read",

You can find the entire list of required permissions in the https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.6.1.json[latest Azure policy for Cloud Manager^].

link:reference_permissions.html[Learn how Cloud Manager uses these permissions].

=== Cloud Provider Accounts

It's now easier to manage multiple AWS and Azure accounts in Cloud Manager by using Cloud Provider Accounts.

In previous releases, you needed to specify cloud provider permissions for each Cloud Manager user account. The permissions are now managed at the Cloud Manager system level by using Cloud Provider Accounts.

image:screenshot_cloud_provider_accounts.gif[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Provider Account Settings page, from which you can add new AWS and Azure accounts to Cloud Manager.]

When you create a new working environment, you simply select the account in which you want to deploy the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system:

image:screenshot_accounts_select_aws.gif[A screenshot that shows the Switch Account option in the Details & Credentials page.]

When you upgrade to 3.6.1, Cloud Manager automatically creates Cloud Provider Accounts for you, based on your current configuration. If you have scripts, backwards compatibility is in place so nothing breaks.

* link:concept_accounts_and_permissions.html[Learn how Cloud Provider Accounts and permissions work]
* link:task_adding_cloud_accounts.html[Learn how to set up and add Cloud Provider Accounts to Cloud Manager]

=== Enhancements to the AWS Cost report

The AWS Cost report now provides more information and is easier to set up.

* The report breaks down the monthly resource costs associated with running Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. You can view monthly costs for compute, EBS storage (including EBS snapshots), S3 storage, and data transfers.

* The report now shows cost savings when you tier inactive data to S3.

* We also simplified how Cloud Manager obtains cost data from AWS.
+
Cloud Manager no longer needs access to billing reports that you store in an S3 bucket. Instead, Cloud Manager uses the Cost Explorer API. You just need to ensure that the IAM policy that provides Cloud Manager with permissions includes the following actions:
+
[source,json]
"ce:GetReservationUtilization",
"ce:GetDimensionValues",
"ce:GetCostAndUsage",
"ce:GetTags"
+
These actions are included in the latest https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.6.1.json[NetApp-provided policy^]. New systems deployed from NetApp Cloud Central automatically include these permissions.

image:screenshot_cost.gif[Screen shot: Shows the costs per month for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance.]

=== Support for new Azure regions

You can now deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the France Central region.

//You can now deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the following Azure regions:

//* Australia Central
//* Australia Central 2
//* France South
//* France Central

== Cloud Manager 3.6 (4 Nov 2018)

Cloud Manager 3.6 includes a new feature.

=== Using Cloud Volumes ONTAP as persistent storage for a Kubernetes cluster

Cloud Manager can now automate the deployment of https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v18.10/introduction.html[NetApp Trident^] on a single Kubernetes cluster so you can use Cloud Volumes ONTAP as persistent storage for containers. Users can then request and manage Persistent Volumes using native Kubernetes interfaces and constructs, while taking advantage of ONTAP's advanced data management features without having to know anything about it.
