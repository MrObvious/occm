== Cloud Manager transition to SaaS (22 June 2020)

We're introducing a software-as-a-service experience for Cloud Manager. This new experience makes it easier for you to use Cloud Manager and enables us to provide additional features to manage your hybrid cloud infrastructure. link:concept_saas.html[Learn more].

== Cloud Manager 3.8.5 (31 May 2020)

* <<New subscription required in the Azure Marketplace>>
* <<Backup to Cloud enhancements>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>

=== New subscription required in the Azure Marketplace

A new subscription is available in the Azure Marketplace. This one-time subscription is required to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 PAYGO (except for your 30-day free trial system). The subscription also enables us to offer add-on features for Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO and BYOL. You’ll be charged from this subscription for every Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO system that you create and each add-on feature that you enable.

Cloud Manager will prompt you to subscribe to this offering when you deploy a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system (9.7 P1 or later).

=== Backup to Cloud enhancements

The following enhancements are now available for Backup to Cloud.

* In Azure, you can now create a new resource group or select an existing resource group instead of having Cloud Manager create one for you. The resource group can't be changed after you enable Backup to Cloud.

* In AWS, you can now back up Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances that reside on a different AWS account than your Cloud Manager AWS account.

* Additional options are now available when selecting the backup schedule for volumes. In addition to daily, weekly, and monthly backup options, you can now select one of the system-defined policies that provide combination policies such as 30 daily, 13 weekly, and 12 monthly backups.

* After deleting all backups for a volume, you can now start creating backups again for that volume. This was a known limitation in the previous release.

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

The following enhancements are available for Cloud Compliance.

* You can now scan S3 buckets that are in different AWS accounts than the Cloud Compliance instance. You just need to create a role on that new account so that the existing Cloud Compliance instance can connect to those buckets. link:task_scanning_s3.html#scanning-buckets-from-additional-aws-accounts[Learn more].
+
If you configured Cloud Compliance before release 3.8.5, you will need to modify the existing link:task_scanning_s3.html#requirements-specific-to-s3[IAM role for the Cloud Compliance instance] to use this functionality.

* You can now filter the contents of the investigation page to display only the results you want to see. Filters include working environment, category, private data, file type, last modified date, and whether the S3 object's permissions are open to public access.
+
