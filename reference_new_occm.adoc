* <<NetApp Cloud Central accounts>>
* <<Connections to Kubernetes clusters>>
* <<Backup and restore with the Cloud Backup Service>>
* <<Deprecation of the Volume View>>

=== NetApp Cloud Central accounts

We've enhanced how you manage your cloud resources. Each Cloud Manager system is now associated with a _NetApp Cloud Central account_. A Cloud Central account provides the highest level of multi-tenancy for Cloud Manager and is planned for other NetApp cloud data services in the future.

In Cloud Manager, a Cloud Central account is a container for the _workspaces_ in which users deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. A workspace is similar to what was previously called a tenant.

You can create as many Cloud Central accounts as you need for your business. You might have one, or a few. For example, you might have two Cloud Manager systems, each deployed in separate Cloud Central accounts to serve different business needs.

==== Integrating your system with Cloud Central accounts

Some time after you upgrade to Cloud Manager 3.7, NetApp will choose specific Cloud Manager systems to integrate with Cloud Central accounts. During this process, NetApp creates an account, assigns new roles to each user, creates workspaces, and places existing working environments in those workspaces. There's no disruption to your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. If you have questions, refer to link:concept_cloud_accounts.html#faq-for-integrating-existing-systems-with-netapp-cloud-accounts[this FAQ].

=== Connections to Kubernetes clusters

It's now easier to connect your Kubernetes clusters to Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. You can connect them directly from the Kubernetes Clusters page:

=== Backup and restore with the Cloud Backup Service

The NetApp Cloud Backup Service for Cloud Volumes ONTAP delivers fully-managed backup and restore capabilities for protection and long-term archive of your cloud data. You can integrate the Cloud Backup Service with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for AWS. Backups created by the service are stored in AWS S3 object storage.

To get started, link:task_setting_up_cbs.html[install and configure the backup agent and then start backup and restore operations]. If you need help, we encourage you to contact us by using the chat icon in Cloud Manager.

=== Deprecation of the Volume View

In previous releases, Cloud Manager provided a separate management view for AWS storage called the _Volume View_. This view is no longer supported. The _Storage System View_ is the default and only view.
