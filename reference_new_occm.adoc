== Cloud Manager 3.6.1 (4 Dec 2018)

Cloud Manager 3.6.1 includes new features and enhancements.

* <<Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5>>
* <<Cloud Provider Accounts>>
* <<Enhancements to the AWS Cost report>>
* <<Support for new Azure regions>>

=== Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5

Cloud Manager now supports the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 release. For details about the release, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_new_95.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 Release Notes^].

==== New Azure permissions required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5

Cloud Manager requires new Azure permissions for key features in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 release. To ensure that Cloud Manager can deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.5 systems, you should update your Cloud Manager policy by adding the following permissions:

----
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/write",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/delete",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/backendAddressPools/join/action",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/frontendIPConfigurations/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/loadBalancingRules/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/probes/read",
"Microsoft.Network/loadBalancers/probes/join/action",
"Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action"
"Microsoft.Authorization/roleDefinitions/write",
"Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write",
"Microsoft.Web/sites/*"
"Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/delete",
"Microsoft.Storage/usages/read",
----

You can find the entire list of required permissions in the https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.6.1.json[latest Azure policy for Cloud Manager^].

=== Cloud Provider Accounts

It's now easier to manage multiple AWS and Azure accounts in Cloud Manager by using Cloud Provider Accounts.

In previous releases, you needed to specify cloud provider permissions for each Cloud Manager user account. The permissions are now managed at the Cloud Manager system level by using Cloud Provider Accounts.

When you create a new working environment, you simply select the account in which you want to deploy the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system:

When you upgrade to 3.6.1, Cloud Manager automatically creates Cloud Provider Accounts for you, based on your current configuration. If you have scripts, backwards compatibility is in place so nothing breaks.

* link:task_adding_azure_accounts.html[Learn how to set up and add Azure accounts to Cloud Manager]

=== Enhancements to the AWS Cost report

The AWS Cost report now provides more information and is easier to set up.

* The report breaks down the monthly resource costs associated with running Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. You can view monthly costs for compute, EBS storage, S3 storage, and data transfers.

* The report now shows cost savings when you tier cold data to S3.

* We also simplified how Cloud Manager obtains cost data from AWS.
+
Cloud Manager no longer needs access to billing reports that you store in an S3 bucket. Instead, Cloud Manager uses the Cost Explorer API. You just need to ensure that the IAM policy that provides Cloud Manager with permissions includes the following actions:

 "ce:GetReservationUtilization",
 "ce:GetDimensionValues",
 "ce:GetCostAndUsage",
 "ce:GetTags"
+
These actions are included in the latest https://s3.amazonaws.com/occm-sample-policies/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.6.1.json[NetApp-provided policy^]. New systems deployed from NetApp Cloud Central automatically include these permissions.

=== Support for new Azure regions

You can now deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP in the following Azure regions:

* Australia Central
* Australia Central 2
* France South
* France Central

== Cloud Manager 3.6 (4 Nov 2018)

Cloud Manager 3.6 includes a new feature.

=== Using Cloud Volumes ONTAP as persistent storage for a Kubernetes cluster

Cloud Manager can now automate the deployment of https://netapp-trident.readthedocs.io/en/stable-v18.10/introduction.html[NetApp Trident^] on a single Kubernetes cluster so you can use Cloud Volumes ONTAP as persistent storage for containers. Users can then request and manage Persistent Volumes using native Kubernetes interfaces and constructs, while taking advantage of ONTAP's advanced data management features without having to know anything about it.
