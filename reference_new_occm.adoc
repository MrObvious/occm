== Cloud Manager 3.8.2 (1 Mar 2020)

* <<Amazon S3 working environments>>
* <<Cloud Compliance enhancements>>
* <<NFS version for volumes>>
* <<Support for Azure US Gov regions>>

=== Amazon S3 working environments

Cloud Manager now automatically discovers information about the Amazon S3 buckets that reside in the AWS account where it's installed. This enables you to easily see details about your S3 buckets, including the region, access level, storage class, and whether the bucket is used with Cloud Volumes ONTAP for backups or data tiering. And you can scan the S3 buckets with Cloud Compliance, as described below.

image:screenshot_amazon_s3.gif[A screenshot that shows the details of an Amazon S3 working environment: the total number of buckets and total number of regions, the number of buckets with active services, and then a table that shows details about each S3 bucket.]

=== Cloud Compliance enhancements

The following enhancements are now available for Cloud Compliance.

* *Support for Amazon S3*
+
Cloud Compliance can now scan your Amazon S3 buckets to identify the personal and sensitive data that resides in S3 object storage. Cloud Compliance can scan any bucket in the account, regardless if it was created for a NetApp solution.
+
link:task_scanning_s3.html[Learn how to get started].

* *Investigation page*
+
A new Investigation page is now available for each type of personal file, sensitive personal file, category, and file type. The page shows details about the affected files and enables you to sort by the files that include the most personal data, sensitive personal data, and names of data subjects. This page replaces the CSV report that was previously available.
+
Here's a sample:

* *PCI DSS Report*
+
A new Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) Report is now available. This report can help you identify the distribution of credit card information across your files. You can view how many files contain credit card information, whether the working environments are protected by encryption or ransomware protection, retention details, and more.
+
link:task_generating_compliance_reports.html[Learn more about the PCI DSS report].

* *New sensitive personal data type*
+
Cloud Compliance can now find ICD-10-CM Medical Codes, which are used in the medical and health industry.

=== NFS version for volumes

You can now select the NFS version to enable on a volume when you create or edit a volume for Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[See the list of supported Azure regions^].

== Cloud Manager 3.8.1 update (16 Feb 2020)

We released a few enhancements to Cloud Manager 3.8.1.

=== Backup to S3 enhancements

* Backup copies are now stored in an S3 bucket that Cloud Manager creates in your AWS account, with one bucket per Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

* In addition to read-write volumes, you can now back up data protection volumes.

* Backup to S3 is now supported in all AWS regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^].

* You can set the backup schedule to daily, weekly, or monthly.

* Cloud Manager no longer needs to set up _private links_ to the Backup to S3 service.
+
NOTE: Cloud Volumes ONTAP does need a connection to S3 through a VPC Endpoint to the Amazon S3 service. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_backup_to_s3.html#requirements[Learn more about the requirements].

Additional S3 permissions are required for these enhancements. The IAM role that provides Cloud Manager with permissions must include permissions from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Cloud Manager policy^].

link:task_backup_to_s3.html[Learn more about Backup to S3].

=== AWS updates

Weâ€™ve introduced support for new EC2 instances and a change in the number of supported data disks for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 and 9.7. Check out the changes in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes.

+
link:task_controlling_private_data.html#categories[Learn more about categories].

=== Enhancements to accounts and subscriptions

We've made it easier to select an AWS account or GCP project and an associated marketplace subscription for a pay-as-you-go Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. These enhancements help to ensure that you're paying from the right account or project.

For example, when you create a system in AWS, click *Edit Credentials* if you don't want to use the default account and subscription:

image:screenshot_accounts_select_aws.gif[A screenshot of the Details & Credentials page in the working environment wizard that shows the Edit Credentials button.]

From there, you can choose the account credentials that you want to use and the associated AWS marketplace subscription. You can even add a marketplace subscription, if you need to.

image:screenshot_accounts_aws.gif[A screenshot of the Edit Account and Add Subscription dialog box. This dialog box enables you to choose a subscription and associate the credentials with a subscription.]

And if you manage multiple AWS subscriptions, you can assign each one of them to different AWS credentials from the Credentials page in the settings:

image:screenshot_aws_add_subscription.gif[A screenshot of the Credentials page where you can add a subscription to AWS credentials from the menu.]

link:task_adding_aws_accounts.html[Learn how to manage AWS credentials in Cloud Manager].

=== Timeline enhancements

The Timeline was enhanced to provide you with more information about the NetApp cloud services that you use.

* The Timeline now shows actions for all Cloud Manager systems within the same Cloud Central account
* You can now find information more easily by filtering, searching, and adding and removing columns
* You can now download the timeline data in CSV format
* In the future, the Timeline will show actions for each NetApp cloud service that you use (but you can filter the information down to a single service)

image:screenshot_timeline.gif[A screenshot of the Timeline that appears in Cloud Manager. The Timeline shows details about the actions that have taken place in Cloud Manager.]

== Cloud Manager 3.8 (8 Jan 2020)

* <<HA enhancements in Azure>>
* <<Data tiering enhancements in GCP>>

=== HA enhancements in Azure

The following enhancements are now available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in Azure.

* *Override CIFS locks for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA in Azure*
+
You can now enable a setting in Cloud Manager that prevents issues with Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage failover during Azure maintenance events. When you enable this setting, Cloud Volumes ONTAP vetoes CIFS locks and resets active CIFS sessions. link:task_overriding_cifs_locks.html[Learn more].

* *HTTPS connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to storage accounts*
+
You can now enable an HTTPS connection from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 HA pair to Azure storage accounts when creating a working environment. Note that enabling this option can impact write performance. You can't change the setting after you create the working environment.

* *Support for Azure general-purpose v2 storage accounts*
+
The storage accounts that Cloud Manager creates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 HA pairs are now general-purpose v2 storage accounts.

=== Data tiering enhancements in GCP

The following enhancements are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP data tiering in GCP.

* *Google Cloud storage classes for data tiering*
+
You can now choose a storage class for data that Cloud Volumes ONTAP tiers to Google Cloud Storage:
+
** Standard Storage (default)
** Nearline Storage
** Coldline Storage
+
https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes[Learn more about Google Cloud storage classes^].
+
link:task_tiering.html#changing-the-storage-class-for-tiered-data[Learn how to change the storage class for Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

* *Data tiering using a service account*
+
Starting with the 9.7 release, Cloud Manager now sets a service account on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. This service account provides permissions for data tiering to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This change provides more security and requires less setup. For step-by-step instructions when deploying a new system, link:task_getting_started_gcp.html[see step 3 on this page].
+
The following image shows the Working Environment wizard where you can select a storage class and service account:
+
image:screenshot_data_tiering_gcp.gif[]

Cloud Manager requires the following GCP permissions for these enhancements, as shown in the latest https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.8.0_GCP.yaml[Cloud Manager policy for GCP^].
