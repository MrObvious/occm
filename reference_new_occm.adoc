== Cloud Manager 3.4.5

Cloud Manager 3.4.5 includes new support and enhancements.

* <<Support for RHEL 7.4 and CentOS 7.4>>
* <<Cloud Manager can now enable programmatic deployments>>
* <<Data disk limit for ONTAP Cloud for AWS>>
* <<Changes coming soon>>

=== Support for RHEL 7.4 and CentOS 7.4

Cloud Manager is now supported on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4 and CentOS 7.4.

=== Cloud Manager can now enable programmatic deployments

In previous releases, you had to manually enable programmatic deployments of ONTAP Cloud from the Azure Marketplace for each Azure subscription. Cloud Manager can now do this for you.

To enable programmatic deployments for an Azure subscription, Cloud Manager requires the following permissions:

"Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/offertypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/read"
"Microsoft.MarketplaceOrdering/offertypes/publishers/offers/plans/agreements/write"

You should update the role definition for the Cloud Manager Operator role to include these permissions.

You can find the entire list of required permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP11022837.html[the policies provided by NetApp^].

=== Data disk limit for ONTAP Cloud for AWS

Due to AWS infrastructure changes, the number of data disks supported in AWS has been reduced. Cloud Manager enforces the following data disk limits:

* A single-node ONTAP Cloud system can have up to 35 data disks.
* An ONTAP Cloud HA node can have up to 32 data disks.

NOTE: The data disk limit does not include the boot disk and root disk.

To ensure that you can utilize the system's maximum capacity before it reaches the maximum number of data disks, Cloud Manager chooses larger disks as ONTAP Cloud systems grow in AWS. For additional details, see link:concept_storage_management.html#disk-size-selection-for-aggregates-in-aws[Disk size selection for aggregates in AWS].

=== Changes coming soon

NetApp occasionally announces changes that will be made in upcoming releases of Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud so that you are provided advance notice.

* <<Deprecation of EC2 instance types>>
* <<New permissions required for ONTAP Cloud 9.4>>

==== Deprecation of EC2 instance types

In June 2018, all versions of ONTAP Cloud will no longer support several EC2 instance types. Existing ONTAP Cloud systems running these instance types will continue to operate normally; however, NetApp strongly recommends changing to a different instance type.

To review pricing differences between instance types and NetApp licenses, go to the AWS Marketplace for http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B011KEZ734[single-node ONTAP Cloud systems^] and for http://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01H4LVJ84[ONTAP Cloud HA pairs^].

[cols=2*,options="header",width=60%]
|===
| Instance type no longer supported
| Recommended instance type

| c3.2xlarge | m4.xlarge
| c4.2xlarge | m4.2xlarge
| m3.xlarge | m4.xlarge
| m3.2xlarge | m4.2xlarge
| r3.xlarge | r4.xlarge
| r3.2xlarge | r4.2xlarge
|===

TIP: M3 and R3 instance types are not supported with ONTAP Cloud data tiering and enhanced performance, so moving to the M4 and R4 instance types allows you to take advantage of those features.

==== New permissions required for ONTAP Cloud 9.4

Cloud Manager will require new permissions for key features in the upcoming ONTAP Cloud 9.4 release. To ensure that your Cloud Manager systems are ready to deploy and manage ONTAP Cloud 9.4 systems, we recommend that you update your Cloud Manager policy now by adding the following permissions:

* For AWS: "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
* For Azure: "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",

You can find the entire list of required permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP11022837.html[the latest policies provided by NetApp^].

== Cloud Manager 3.4.4

Cloud Manager 3.4.4 includes new features and enhancements.

* <<Support for Azure France regions>>
* <<Enhancement to default disk size selection in AWS>>

=== Support for Azure France regions

Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud are now supported in the France Central and France South regions.

=== Enhancement to default disk size selection in AWS

Cloud Manager now chooses larger disks as ONTAP Cloud systems grow in AWS.

When Cloud Manager creates new aggregates for ONTAP Cloud systems in AWS, it steadily increases the disk size in an aggregate, as the number of aggregates in the system increases. Cloud Manager does this to ensure that you can utilize the system's maximum capacity before it reaches the maximum number of data disks allowed by AWS.

For example, Cloud Manager might choose the following disk sizes for aggregates in an ONTAP Cloud Premium or BYOL system:

[cols=3*,options="header",width=60%]
|===

| Aggregate number
| Disk size
| Max aggregate capacity

| 1 |	500 MB | 3 TB
| 4 | 1 TB | 6 TB
| 6 | 2 TB | 12 TB

|===

You can choose the disk size yourself by using the advanced allocation option.

== Cloud Manager 3.4.3

You can now create ONTAP Snapshot copies on demand.

== Cloud Manager 3.4.2

Cloud Manager 3.4.2 includes several new features and enhancements.

* <<Enhancements to the Cloud Storage Automation Report>>
* <<Support for multiple AWS accounts when using an IAM role>>
* <<Support for multiple Azure accounts>>
* <<Security group selection for the HA mediator>>

=== Enhancements to the Cloud Storage Automation Report

The Cloud Storage Automation Report identifies several savings opportunities, including savings for unattached EBS volumes and unassociated snapshots. Starting in version 3.4.2, Cloud Manager now shows you the list of those volumes and snapshots and enables you to delete them.

The following image shows how you can access the list of unattached volumes and unassociated snapshots:

image:screenshot_csa_update.png[Screen shot: Shows the "View List" button that is now available for Unattached EBS Volumes and Unassociated EBS Snapshots, which are available in the Operations section.]

The following image shows an example of how you can delete unattached EBS volumes:

For more details, see link:concept_storage_automation.html[Cloud Storage Automation].

=== Support for multiple AWS accounts when using an IAM role

Cloud Manager now enables you to choose the AWS account to use when launching an ONTAP Cloud system:

image:screenshot_aws_accounts.gif[Screen shot: Shows the link to select a different account in the Details and Credentials page.]

This feature is supported if you associated the Cloud Manager instance with an IAM role.

Before you can choose from multiple AWS accounts, you must first delegate access across those accounts.

link:task_setting_up_cloud_manager.html#adding-additional-aws-accounts-to-cloud-manager[Adding additional AWS accounts to Cloud Manager]

=== Support for multiple Azure accounts

Cloud Manager now enables you to choose the Azure subscription to use when deploying an ONTAP Cloud system:

image:screenshot_azure_subscriptions.gif[Screen shot: Shows the link to select a different subscription in the Details and Credentials page.]

Before you can choose from multiple Azure subscriptions, you must first bind the Active Directory service principal to multiple Azure subscriptions.

link:task_getting_started_azure.html#granting-azure-permissions-to-cloud-manager[Granting Azure permissions to Cloud Manager]

NOTE: This change is possible because Cloud Manager no longer associates user accounts with specific Azure subscriptions. Instead, Cloud Manager obtains the list of Azure subscriptions that are bound to the Active Directory service principal.

=== Security group selection for the HA mediator

You can now choose an existing security group for the HA mediator when you deploy a new ONTAP Cloud HA system. Cloud Manager always created this security group in previous releases.

== Cloud Manager 3.4.1

Cloud Manager 3.4.1 includes several new features and enhancements.

* <<Cloud Storage Automation (Beta)>>
* <<Improved reliability when upgrading ONTAP Cloud systems>>
* <<Resource group naming in Azure>>
* <<Support for Azure US Gov regions>>
* <<Improvement when replicating data from on-premises ONTAP systems>>

=== Cloud Storage Automation (Beta)

Cloud Manager can now analyze your cloud storage to show you savings opportunities, data protection enhancements, and operations that can optimize the cloud storage associated with your AWS account. For example, Cloud Manager identifies savings opportunities for unassociated EBS volumes and snapshots, the EBS volumes that impact your recovery point objective, and EBS volumes that are running out of space.

image:screenshot_csa.jpg[Screenshot that shows the Cloud Storage Automation Report.]

For more details, see link:concept_storage_automation.html[Cloud Storage Automation].

=== Improved reliability when upgrading ONTAP Cloud systems

Cloud Manager now leverages Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration when upgrading ONTAP Cloud software. This enhancement improves the reliability of downloading the software image, which reduces the chances of timeouts and proxy failures.

=== Resource group naming in Azure

You can now specify the name of the Azure resource group that Cloud Manager creates for an ONTAP Cloud system when you create a new working environment.

=== Support for Azure US Gov regions

You can now deploy Cloud Manager and ONTAP Cloud BYOL in the following Azure regions:

* US Gov Arizona
* US Gov Texas
* US Gov Virginia

To deploy Cloud Manager in these regions, you must create a CentOS 7.3 virtual machine from the Azure Marketplace, download the Cloud Manager installer from the NetApp Support Site, and then install the software. After Cloud Manager is running, you can deploy ONTAP Cloud BYOL systems in the these regions just like any other region.

=== Improvement when replicating data from on-premises ONTAP systems

When you replicate data from an on-premises ONTAP system, Cloud Manager now associates the LIF to the default IPspace.

== Cloud Manager 3.4

Cloud Manager is now integrated with NetApp Cloud Central.

NetApp Cloud Central is a suite of data-driven services that allows you to run critical applications in the cloud, create automated DR sites, back up your SaaS data, and effectively migrate and control data across multiple clouds leveraging NetApp's prominent data management expertise and technologies.

Cloud Manager's integration with NetApp Cloud Central provides several benefits, including a simplified deployment experience, a single location to view and manage multiple Cloud Manager systems, and centralized user authentication.

With centralized user authentication, you can use the same set of credentials across Cloud Manager systems and between Cloud Manager and other data services, such as Cloud Sync. It's also easy to reset your password if you forgot it.

You can keep using your existing Cloud Manager systems as is, but if you would like to use this new experience, you can deploy a new Cloud Manager 3.4 system from NetApp Cloud Central and then discover any existing ONTAP Cloud systems from the new Cloud Manager system.
