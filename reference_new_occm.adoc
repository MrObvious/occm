== Cloud Manager 3.9 (1 Nov 2020)

* <<Cloud Tiering enhancements>>
* <<Azure Private Link connection for Cloud Volumes ONTAP>>

=== Cloud Tiering enhancements

* When you set up data tiering from your volumes, Cloud Tiering now identifies the Snapshot used size for each volume. This data can help you decide which volume tiering policy to use.

* Cloud Tiering now enables inactive data reporting on HDD aggregates, if the cluster is running ONTAP 9.6 or later.
+
This enhancement makes it easier for Cloud Tiering to show you the potential savings from tiering cold data.

* Cloud Tiering now prompts you to change thick-provisioned volumes to thin-provisioned volumes, in order to enable data tiering on the volumes in an aggregate.

=== Azure Private Link connection for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

By default, Cloud Manager now enables an Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts. A Private Link secures connections between endpoints in Azure. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview[Learn more^].
