== Cloud Manager 3.8 (8 Jan 2020)

* <<HA enhancements in Azure>>
* <<Data tiering enhancements in GCP>>

=== HA enhancements in Azure

The following enhancements are now available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in Azure.

* *Override CIFS locks for Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA in Azure*
+
You can now enable a setting in Cloud Manager that prevents issues with Cloud Volumes ONTAP storage failover during Azure maintenance events. When you enable this setting, Cloud Volumes ONTAP vetoes CIFS locks and resets active CIFS sessions. link:task_overriding_cifs_locks.html[Learn more].

* *HTTPS connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to storage accounts*
+
You can now enable an HTTPS connection from a Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 HA pair to Azure storage accounts when creating a working environment. Note that enabling this option can impact write performance. You can't change the setting after you create the working environment.

* *Support for Azure general-purpose v2 storage accounts*
+
The storage accounts that Cloud Manager creates for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.7 HA pairs are now general-purpose v2 storage accounts.

=== Data tiering enhancements in GCP

The following enhancements are available for Cloud Volumes ONTAP data tiering in GCP.

* *Google Cloud storage classes for data tiering*
+
You can now choose a storage class for data that Cloud Volumes ONTAP tiers to Google Cloud Storage:
+
** Standard Storage (default)
** Nearline Storage
** Coldline Storage
+

* *Data tiering using a service account*
+
Starting with the 9.7 release, Cloud Manager now sets a service account on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance. This service account provides permissions for data tiering to a Google Cloud Storage bucket. This change provides more security and requires less setup. For step-by-step instructions when deploying a new system, link:task_getting_started_gcp.html[see step 3 on this page].
