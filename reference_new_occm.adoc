== Cloud Manager 3.5.1

Cloud Manager 3.5.1 includes new features and enhancements.

* <<Tiering levels for cold data>>
* <<Providing Azure permissions using a Managed Service Identity>>
* <<New used capacity charts>>

=== Tiering levels for cold data

After you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP, you can change the Amazon S3 storage class or the Azure Blob storage tier in which you want to store cold data. Changing the tiering level can reduce your storage costs, if you do not plan to access the data. The access costs are higher if you do access the data, so you must take that into consideration before you change the tiering level.

The tiering level is system wide--it is not per volume. For details about changing the tiering level, see link:task_tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

==== AWS tiering levels

In AWS, Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses *Standard* as the default storage class for data tiering to Amazon S3. You can change the storage class to either *Standard-Infrequent Access* or *One Zone-Infrequent Access*. When you change the tiering level, cold data starts in the *Standard* storage class and moves to the storage class that you selected, if the data is not accessed after 30 days. For details about S3 storage classes, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes[AWS documentation^].

==== Azure tiering levels

In Azure, Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses the Azure *hot* storage tier as the default for data tiering to Blob storage. You can change to the Azure *cool* storage tier. When you change the tiering level, cold data starts in the *hot* storage tier and moves to the *cool* storage tier, if the data is not accessed after 30 days. For details about Azure Blob storage tiers, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-storage-tiers[Azure documentation^].

=== Providing Azure permissions using a Managed Service Identity

You can now provide Azure permissions to Cloud Manager by using a Managed Service Identity. A Managed Service Identity allows a Cloud Manager virtual machine in Azure to identify itself to Azure Active Directory without providing any credentials. This method is simpler than manually setting up an Azure service principal and providing the credentials to Cloud Manager.

To use a Managed Service Identity with Cloud Manager, follow link:task_getting_started_azure.html[instructions for new Cloud Manager virtual machines] or link:task_enabling_msi.html[instructions for existing Cloud Manager virtual machines].

For more information about Managed Service Identities, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-service-identity/overview[Azure documentation^].

=== New used capacity charts

Cloud Manager now provides a graphical representation of used capacity when viewing volumes and aggregates.

== Cloud Manager 3.5

Cloud Manager 3.5 includes new features and enhancements.

* <<Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4>>
* <<New permissions required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4>>
* <<Cloud Manager integration with NetApp Cloud Central>>
* <<Support for the m4.large instance type>>
* <<Marketplace image now based on RHEL 7.4>>

=== Support for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4

You can now deploy new Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4 systems from Cloud Manager and upgrade your existing systems to the 9.4 release. Cloud Manager also provides support for https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/reference_new_94.html[the new features introduced in Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4^].

=== New permissions required for Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4

Cloud Manager requires new permissions for key features in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4 release. To ensure that your Cloud Manager systems can deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.4 systems, you must update your Cloud Manager policy by adding the following permissions:

* For AWS: "ec2:DescribeInstanceAttribute",
+
Cloud Manager uses this permission to verify that enhanced networking is enabled for supported instance types.

* For Azure: "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",
+
Cloud Manager uses this permission to enable VNet service endpoints for data tiering.

You can find the entire list of required permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/info/web/ECMP11022837.html[the latest policies provided by NetApp^].

=== Cloud Manager integration with NetApp Cloud Central

When upgrading to Cloud Manager 3.5, NetApp will choose specific Cloud Manager systems to integrate with NetApp Cloud Central, if they are not already integrated. During this process, NetApp migrates all local user accounts in your Cloud Manager system to the centralized user authentication available in Cloud Central. After the upgrade is complete, you simply need to log in.

If you have questions, refer to link:reference_integration_faq.html[this FAQ].

=== Support for the m4.large instance type

Cloud Manager is now supported with the m4.large EC2 instance type. m3.large is no longer supported.

For a list of supported Cloud Manager configurations, see link:reference_cloud_mgr_reqs.html[Cloud Manager host requirements].

=== Marketplace image now based on RHEL 7.4

The operating system for the Cloud Manager marketplace image in AWS and Azure is now Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.4.
