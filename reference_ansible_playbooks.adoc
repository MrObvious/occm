Ansible can help you automate the deployment and management of Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP. We have developed a few sample playbooks that you can use to get started.

For example, you can use the sample playbooks to deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP, create an aggregate, and create a volume. Modify the samples for your environment or create new playbooks based on the samples.
