summary: Cloud Manager can discover the ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, in a NetApp Private Storage configuration, and in the IBM Cloud. Discovering an ONTAP cluster enables you to provision storage, update shelf and disk firmware (if needed), replicate data, back up data, and tier cold data from an on-prem cluster to the cloud.

Cloud Manager can discover the ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, in a NetApp Private Storage configuration, and in the IBM Cloud. Discovering an ONTAP cluster enables you to provision storage, update shelf and disk firmware (if needed), replicate data, back up data, and tier cold data from an on-prem cluster to the cloud.

.What you'll need

* A Connector installed in a cloud provider or on your premises.
+
If you want to tier cold data to the cloud, then you should review requirements for the Connector based on where you plan to tier cold data.
+

** link:task_managing_connectors.html[Switching between Connectors^]
** link:concept_cloud_tiering.html[Learn about Cloud Tiering^]

* The cluster management IP address and the password for the admin user account to add the cluster to Cloud Manager.
+
Cloud Manager discovers ONTAP clusters using HTTPS. If you use custom firewall policies, they must meet the following requirements:

** The Connector host must allow outbound HTTPS access through port 443.
+
If the Connector is in the cloud, all outbound communication is allowed by the predefined security group.

** The ONTAP cluster must allow inbound HTTPS access through port 443.
+
The default "mgmt" firewall policy allows inbound HTTPS access from all IP addresses. If you modified this default policy, or if you created your own firewall policy, you must associate the HTTPS protocol with that policy and enable access from the Connector host.

* A valid set of NetApp Support Site credentials for accessing the Active IQ page.

== Discovering clusters from the Active IQ page

You can use the Active IQ service/page in Cloud Manager to discover, view, and manage all your on-prem clusters in a single location.

*Note:* The Active IQ page shows systems with a valid support contract. If contracts expire, a grace period of 90 days is given in which systems continue to be visible. Thereafter, systems are not searchable or visible on the Active IQ page. See how to link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/task_renew_support_contracts_for_your_systems.html[renew your support contract from Active IQ Digital Advisor^]. However, if you have already discovered on-prem clusters, you can continue to manage certain aspects using the Cloud Manager UI.

.Steps

. Click the *Active IQ* tab, enter your NetApp Support Site user name and password, and click *Save*.
+
The clusters that have a valid support contract are displayed along with a status of whether they have been discovered in Cloud Manager.

. If you're prompted, create a Connector.
+
Refer to the links above for more details.

. Click *Discover* for the cluster that you want to manage through Cloud Manager.

. On the _ONTAP Cluster Details_ page, enter the user name and password for the admin user account. The cluster management IP address is populated based on information from Active IQ.

. On the Details page, enter a name and description for the working environment, and then click *Go*.

.Result

Cloud Manager discovers the cluster and adds it to the working environment. You can now create volumes, replicate data to and from the cluster, set up data tiering to the cloud, back up volumes to the cloud, and launch System Manager to perform advanced tasks.

== Discovering clusters from the Working Environments page

You can discover the ONTAP clusters and add them to a working environment from the Working Environments page.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, click *Add Working Environment* and select *On-Premises ONTAP*.

. If you're prompted, create a Connector.
+
Refer to the links above for more details.

. On the _ONTAP Cluster Details_ page, enter the cluster management IP address, the password for the admin user account, and the location of the cluster.
+

. On the Details page, enter a name and description for the working environment, and then click *Go*.

.Result

Cloud Manager discovers the cluster and adds it to the working environment. You can now create volumes, replicate data to and from the cluster, set up data tiering to the cloud, back up volumes to the cloud, and launch System Manager to perform advanced tasks.
