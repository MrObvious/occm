== Reviewing prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Compliance.

=== Database requirements

Cloud Compliance can scan schemas from the following databases:

* Oracle
* MongoDB
* SAP HANA
* SQL Server (MSSQL)

IMPORTANT: The statistics gathering feature *must be enabled* in the database.

You must have the following information to connect to the database:

* IP Address or host name
* Port
* Credentials that allow read access to the schemas
* Service name (only for accessing an Oracle DB)

== Adding the database server

When configuring a new DB server, when choosing a user+password, itâ€™;s important to choose one that has full read permissions to all the schemas and tables they wish to scan. We recommend creating a dedicated user for the Cloud Compliance system with all the desired permissions.

== Selecting the schemas you want to scan

You can stop or start scanning schemas at any time from the Scan Configuration page.
