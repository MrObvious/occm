== Cost

*_===> NEED LINK_*

Note that your subscription and charging are maintained by the Amazon FSx for ONTAP service and not by Cloud Manager.

== Supported regions

https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/[View supported Amazon regions.^]

== Before you get started

//* Cloud Manager can discover existing Cloud Volumes Service for AWS subscriptions and volumes. See the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/media/cvs_aws_account_setup.pdf[NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for AWS Account Setup Guide^] if you haven't set up your subscription yet. You must follow this setup process for each region before you can add the AWS subscriptions and volumes in Cloud Manager.

//* You need to obtain the Cloud Volumes API key and secret key so you can provide them to Cloud Manager. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/reference_cloud_volume_apis.html#finding-the-api-url-api-key-and-secret-key[For instructions, refer to Cloud Volumes Service for AWS documentation^].

== Quick start

Get started with FSx for ONTAP in a few steps.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Create an FSx for ONTAP working environment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You must create a working environment for the volumes based on your Amazon FSx for ONTAP subscription.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't have a link:concept_connectors.html[Connector], an Account Admin needs to create one. If you already have an AWS Connector, you can add FSx for ONTAP permissions to the IAM role for the Connector or create a new IAM role.  link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[Learn how to create a Connector in AWS^].

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Add or discover volumes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud volumes that already exist for this subscription appear in the new working environment. Otherwise you create new volumes from Cloud Manager.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Manage your cloud volumes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Use Cloud Manager to manage your volumes, create advanced workflows, and configure additional services such as replication, sync, and Data Sense.

== Getting help

*_WHAT IS PRIMARY SUPPORT PATH??_*
//Use the Cloud Manager chat for general service questions.

For technical support issues associated with your cloud volumes, use your 20 digit “930” serial number located in the "Support" tab of the Cloud Volumes Service user interface. Use this support ID when opening a web ticket or calling for support. Be sure to activate your Cloud Volumes Service serial number for support from the Cloud Volumes Service user interface. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud_volumes/aws/task_activating_support_entitlement.html[Those steps are explained here^].

== Limitations

*_ARE THERE LIMIATIONS  WE NEED TO DOCUMENT? I DON'T THINK THE FOLLOWING APPLY FOR FSX_*

* Cloud Manager doesn't support data replication between working environments when using Cloud Volumes Service volumes.

* Removing your Amazon FSx for ONTAP subscription from Cloud Manager isn't supported. You can do this only through the AWS Management Console.
