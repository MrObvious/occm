Gain control of your private data by viewing details about the personal data and sensitive personal data in your organization. You can also gain visibility by reviewing the categories and file types that Cloud Compliance found in your data.

By default, the Cloud Compliance dashboard displays compliance data for all working environments and databases.

If you want to see data for only some of the working environments, <<Viewing Dashboard data for specific working environments,select those working environments>>.

You can also filter the results from the Data Investigation page and download a report of the results. See <<Filtering data in the Data Investigation page,Filtering data in the Data Investigation page>> for details.

== Personal data

Cloud Compliance automatically identifies specific words, strings, and patterns (Regex) inside the data. For example, Personal Identification Information (PII), credit card numbers, social security numbers, bank account numbers, and more. <<Types of personal data,See the full list>>.

For some types of personal data, Cloud Compliance uses _proximity validation_ to validate its findings. The validation occurs by looking for one or more predefined keywords in proximity to the personal data that was found. For example, Cloud Compliance identifies a U.S. social security number (SSN) as a SSN if it sees a proximity word next to it--for example, _SSN_ or _social security_. <<Types of personal data,The list below>> shows when Cloud Compliance uses proximity validation.

== Sensitive personal data

Cloud Compliance automatically identifies special types of sensitive personal information, as defined by privacy regulations such as https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN#d1e2051-1-1[articles 9 and 10 of the GDPR^]. For example, information regarding a person's health, ethnic origin, or sexual orientation. <<Types of sensitive personal data,See the full list>>.

Cloud Compliance uses artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and cognitive computing (CC) to understand the meaning of the content that it scans in order to extract entities and categorize it accordingly.

For example, one sensitive GDPR data category is ethnic origin. Because of its NLP abilities, Cloud Compliance can distinguish the difference between a sentence that reads "George is Mexican" (indicating sensitive data as specified in article 9 of the GDPR), versus "George is eating Mexican food."

NOTE: Only English is supported when scanning for sensitive personal data. Support for more languages will be added later.

=== Viewing files that contain sensitive personal data

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Cloud Compliance*.

. To investigate the details for all sensitive personal data, click the icon next to the sensitive personal data percentage.

=== Types of sensitive personal data

The sensitive personal data that Cloud Compliance can find in files includes the following:

Criminal Procedures Reference::	Data concerning a natural person’s criminal convictions and offenses.
Ethnicity Reference::	Data concerning a natural person’s racial or ethnic origin.
Health Reference:: Data concerning a natural person’s health.
ICD-9-CM Medical Codes:: Codes used in the medical and health industry.
ICD-10-CM Medical Codes:: Codes used in the medical and health industry.
Philosophical Beliefs Reference::	Data concerning a natural person’s philosophical beliefs.
Religious Beliefs Reference::	Data concerning a natural person’s religious beliefs.
Sex Life or Orientation Reference::	Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

== Categories

Cloud Compliance takes the data that it scanned and divides it into different types of categories. Categories are topics based on AI analysis of the content and metadata of each file. <<Types of categories,See the list of categories>>.

Categories can help you understand what's happening with your data by showing you the types of information that you have. For example, a category like resumes or employee contracts can include sensitive data. When you investigate the results, you might find that employee contracts are stored in an insecure location. You can then correct that issue.

NOTE: Only English is supported for categories. Support for more languages will be added later.

=== Viewing files by categories

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Cloud Compliance*.

. Click the *Investigate Results* icon for one of the top 4 categories directly from the main screen, or click *View All* and then click the icon for any of the categories.
+

== File types

Cloud Compliance takes the data that it scanned and breaks it down by file type. Reviewing your file types can help you control your sensitive data because you might find that certain file types are not stored correctly. <<Types of files,See the list of file types>>.

For example, you might be storing CAD files that include very sensitive information about your organization. If they are unsecured, you can take control of the sensitive data by restricting permissions or moving the files to another location.

=== Viewing file types

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Cloud Compliance*.

. Click the *Investigate Results* icon for one of the top 4 file types directly from the main screen, or click *View All* and then click the icon for any of the file types.
+
image:screenshot_file_types.gif[A screenshot of the file types dialog box where you can click the Investigate Results icon next to a file type.]

. Investigate the data by searching, sorting, expanding details for a specific file, clicking *Investigate Results* to see masked information, or by downloading the file list.

=== Types of files

Cloud Compliance scans all files for category and metadata insights and displays all file types in the file types section of the dashboard.

But when Cloud Compliance detects Personal Identifiable Information (PII), or when it performs a DSAR search, only the following file formats are supported:
.PDF, .DOCX, .DOC, .PPTX, .XLS, .XLSX, .CSV, .TXT, .RTF, and .JSON.

== Viewing files that contain unique identifiers from your databases

A feature we call _data fusion_ allows you to scan your files to identify whether unique identifiers from your databases are found in those files - kind of like making your own list of "personal sensitive data" that is identified in Cloud Compliance scans. You can choose the identifiers by selecting a specific column, or columns, in a database table. This gives you the full picture about where potential sensitive data resides in _all_ your files.

For example, the diagram below shows how data fusion is used to scan your volumes and buckets for occurrences of all your Customer IDs in your Oracle database.

image:diagram_compliance_data_fusion.png[A diagram showing how content from your databases can be used as a source to identify files that contain the same data.]

.Steps

You must have added at least one database server to Cloud Compliance before you can add data fusion sources.

. In the Scan Configuration page, click *Manage Data Fusion* in the database where the source data resides.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_manage_data_fusion.png[A screenshot of selecting the Manage Data Fusion button to add a source column.]

. Click *Add your first Data Fusion sources* on the next page.

. In the _Add Data Fusion Source_ page, identify the Database Schema (in the format `DatabaseName,SchemaName`), the Table name in that schema, and the Column, or Columns, that contain the unique identifiers.
+
When adding multiple columns, enter each column name, or table view name, on a separate line.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_data_fusion.png[A screenshot of identifying the schema, table, and column for the data fusion source.]

. Click *Add Data Fusion Source*.
+
The Data Fusion inventory page displays the database source columns you have configured for Cloud Compliance to scan.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_data_fusion_list.png[A screenshot of all the data source references you have configured with Data Fusion.]
+
Note that if you later decide not to scan your files using a specific Data Fusion source, you can select the source row and click *Delete Data Fusion Source*.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_delete_data_fusion.png[A screenshot showing how to remove a data fusion source.]

. View the results of these scans in the Dashboard under the "Personal" results section, or in the Investigation page in the "Personal Data" filter. Each source column you added appears in the filter list as "Database.Schema.Table.Column", for example `Oracle1.Accounts.Customers.Customer ID`.

== Viewing Dashboard data for specific working environments

You can filter the contents of the Cloud Compliance dashboard to see compliance data for all working environments and databases, or for just specific working environments.

When you filter the dashboard, Cloud Compliance scopes the compliance data and reports to just those working environments that you selected.

.Steps

. Click the filter drop-down, select the working environments that you'd like to view data for, and click *View*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_filter.gif[]

== Filtering data in the Data Investigation page

You can filter the contents of the investigation page to display only the results you want to see. If you want to save a CSV version of the content as a report after you have refined it, click the image:button_download.png[The Download Report button.] button.

image:screenshot_compliance_investigation_filtered.png[A screenshot of the filters available when refining the results in the investigation page.]

* The top-level tabs allow you to view data from files (unstructured data) or from databases (structured data).

* The controls at the top of each column allow you to sort the results in numerical or alphabetical order.

* The left-pane filters enable you to refine the results by working environment, storage repository, category, private data, file type, last modified date, and whether the S3 object’s permissions are open to public access.

* The _Highlights_ filters at the bottom of the Filters pane list a group of predefined filters that provide commonly requested combinations of filters; like a saved database query.

=== Predefined Highlights filters

The provided Highlights filters include:

[cols="25,35,35",width=85%,options="header"]
|===
| Name
| Description
| Logic

| S3 publicly-exposed private data | S3 Objects containing personal or sensitive personal information, with open Public read access. | (S3 Public) AND (contains personal OR sensitive personal info)
| PCI DSS – Stale data over 30 days | Files containing Credit Card information, last modified over 30 days ago. | Contains credit card AND last modified over 30 days
| HIPAA – Stale data over 30 days | Files containing Health information, last modified over 30 days ago. | Contains health data (defined same way as in HIPAA report) AND last modified over 30 days
| Private data – Stale over 7 years | Files containing personal or sensitive personal information, last modified over 7 years ago. | Files containing personal or sensitive personal information, last modified over 7 years ago
| GDPR – European citizens | Files and DB Tables containing over 10 identifiers of EU citizens. | Files and DB Tables containing over 10 identifiers of EU citizens (any one of the national identifiers of the European countries. Does not include Brazil, California, USA SSN, Israel, South Africa)
| CCPA – California residents | Files containing over 10 California Driver’s License identifiers or DB Tables with this identifier. | Files containing over 10 California Driver’s License identifiers OR DB Tables containing California Driver’s license
| Data Subject names – High risk | Files with over 50 Data Subject names. | Files with over 50 Data Subject names
| Email Addresses – High risk | Files with over 50 Email Addresses, or DB Columns with over 50% of their rows containing Email Addresses | Files with over 50 Email Addresses, or DB Columns with over 50% of their rows containing Email Addresses
| Private data – High risk | Files with over 50 PIIs (Personal or Sensitive Personal information), or DB Columns with over 50% of their rows containing PIIs. | Files with over 50 PIIs (Personal or Sensitive Personal information), or DB Columns with over 50% of their rows containing PIIs
|===

== What’s included in each file list report (CSV file)

From each Investigation page you can download file lists (in CSV format) that include details about the identified files. If there are more than 10,000 results, only the top 10,000 appear in the list.

Each file list includes the following information:

* File name
* Location type
* Working environment
* Storage repository
* Protocol
* File path
* File type
* Category
* Personal information
* Sensitive personal information
* Deletion detection date
+
A deletion detection date identifies the date that the file was deleted or moved. This enables you to identify when sensitive files have been moved. Deleted files aren't part of the file number count that appears in the dashboard or on the Investigation page. The files only appear in the CSV reports.

== Accuracy of information found

NetApp can't guarantee 100% accuracy of the personal data and sensitive personal data that Cloud Compliance identifies. You should always validate the information by reviewing the data.

Based on our testing, the table below shows the accuracy of the information that Cloud Compliance finds. We break it down by _precision_ and _recall_:

Precision:: The probability that what Cloud Compliance finds has been identified correctly. For example, a precision rate of 90% for personal data means that 9 out of 10 files identified as containing personal information, actually contain personal information. 1 out of 10 files would be a false positive.

Recall:: The probability for Cloud Compliance to find what it should. For example, a recall rate of 70% for personal data means that Cloud Compliance can identify 7 out of 10 files that actually contain personal information in your organization. Cloud Compliance would miss 30% of the data and it won’t appear in the dashboard.

Cloud Compliance is in a Controlled Availability release and we are constantly improving the accuracy of our results. Those improvements will be automatically available in future Cloud Compliance releases.

[cols="25,20,20",width=80%,options="header"]
|===
| Type
| Precision
| Recall

| Personal data - General | 90%-95% | 60%-80%
| Personal data - Country identifiers | 30%-60% | 40%-60%
| Sensitive personal data | 80%-95% | 20%-30%
| Categories | 90%-97% | 60%-80%
