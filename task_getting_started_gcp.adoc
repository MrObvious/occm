Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP by setting up GCP and then deploying Cloud Manager software from NetApp Cloud Central.

Note the following before you get started:

* Cloud Manager must be installed in Google Cloud Platform in order to deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP.
* The only way to deploy Cloud Manager in GCP is from NetApp Cloud Central.

=== image:number1.png[Number 1] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC so Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
This step is important because Cloud Manager can't deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_cloud_manager.html#outbound-internet-access[Cloud Manager] and link:reference_networking_gcp.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== image:number2.png[Number 2] Set up GCP for data tiering

[role="quick-margin-para"]
A few steps are required if you want to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage (a Google Cloud Storage bucket):

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-google-access[Configure the Cloud Volumes ONTAP subnet for Private Google Access^].

.. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role[Create a service account that has the Storage Admin role^].

.. Go to your https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^], enable interoperability access, and create access keys for the service account that you just created.
+
You'll need to link:task_adding_gcp_accounts.html[add the keys to Cloud Manager during setup] so it can use the keys to manage a Cloud Storage bucket for data tiering.

=== image:number3.png[Number 3] Enable Google Cloud APIs

[role="quick-margin-para"]
https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Enable the following Google Cloud APIs in your project^]. These APIs are required to deploy Cloud Manager and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API
* Compute Engine API
* Stackdriver Logging API

=== image:number4.png[Number 4] Set up GCP permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Make sure that two sets of permissions are in place:

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that the GCP user who deploys Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central has the permissions defined in the https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Setup_As_Service_3.7.3_GCP.yaml[NetApp Cloud Central policy for GCP^].

.. Set up a service account that has the permissions that Cloud Manager needs to create and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems on your behalf. This service account is different from the service account that's used for data tiering.
+
* https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role[Create a custom role in GCP^] that includes the permissions defined in the https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_Cloud_Manager_3.7.3_GCP.yaml[Cloud Manager policy for GCP^].
+
This policy is different than the policy in step 4a.

* https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts#creating_a_service_account[Create a GCP service account, apply the custom role that you just created, and grant users access to the service account^].
+
You'll associate this service account with the Cloud Manager VM instance in the next step.

=== image:number5.png[Number 5] Launch Cloud Manager from NetApp Cloud Central

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager software is required to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP. It takes just a few minutes to launch a Cloud Manager instance in GCP from https://cloud.netapp.com[Cloud Central^]. Cloud Manager must be installed in GCP from Cloud Central before you can deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
NOTE: In this step, a Google form prompts you to log in to your Google account. You'll see a notification from Google that the Cloud Central site is unverified. NetApp is currently working closely with Google to finalize the verification process. Additional information pertaining to the NetApp privacy policies and terms of service can be accessed at: https://www.netapp.com/us/legal/privacypolicy/index.aspx and https://www.netapp.com/us/how-to-buy/stc.aspx.

=== image:number6.png[Number 6] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Once Cloud Manager is ready, just click Create, select the type of system that you would like to deploy, and complete the steps in the wizard. After 25 minutes, your first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system should be up and running.
