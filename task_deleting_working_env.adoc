summary: You should always delete Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems from Cloud Manager, rather than from your cloud provider's console. For example, if you terminate a licensed Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance from your cloud provider, then you can't use the license key for another instance. You must delete the working environment from Cloud Manager to release the license.

You should always delete Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems from Cloud Manager, rather than from your cloud provider's console. For example, if you terminate a licensed Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance from your cloud provider, then you can't use the license key for another instance. You must delete the working environment from Cloud Manager to release the license.

When you delete a working environment, Cloud Manager terminates Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances and deletes disks and snapshots.

Resources managed by other services like backups for Cloud Backup and instances for Cloud Compliance and Monitoring are not deleted when you delete a working environment. You'll need to manually delete them yourself. If you don't, then you'll continue to receive charges for these resources.

WARNING: Cloud Volumes ONTAP instances have termination protection enabled to help prevent accidental termination from AWS. However, if you do terminate a Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance from AWS, you must go to the AWS CloudFormation console and delete the instance's stack. The stack name is the name of the working environment.

.Steps

. If you enabled Cloud Backup on the working environment, link:task_managing_backups.html#deleting-backups[delete all backups of the volumes].
+
Cloud Backup doesnâ€™t automatically delete backups when you delete a system, and there is no current support in the UI to delete the backups after the system has been deleted.

. If you enabled Cloud Compliance or Monitoring on this working environment and no other working environments use those services, then you'll need to delete the instances for those services.
