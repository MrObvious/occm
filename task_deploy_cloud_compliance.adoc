Complete a few steps to deploy the Cloud Compliance instance in your Cloud Manager workspace. You can deploy Cloud Compliance in the cloud or on an on-premises system.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you don't already have a Connector, create a Connector in Azure or AWS. See link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[creating a Connector in AWS^] or link:task_creating_connectors_azure.html[creating a Connector in Azure^].

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Review prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Ensure that your environment can meet the prerequisites. This includes outbound internet access for the instance, connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Compliance over port 80, and more. <<Reviewing prerequisites,See the complete list>>.

* When installed on the cloud, you need 16 vCPUs for the Cloud Compliance instance. See link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#the-cloud-compliance-instance[more details about the instance type^].

* When installed on premises, you need a Linux system with the appropriate link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html#deploying-the-cloud-compliance-instance-on-premises[OS, CPUs, RAM, and capacity^].

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Deploy Cloud Compliance

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Launch the installation wizard to deploy the Cloud Compliance instance.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You can deploy Cloud Compliance in the cloud or in an on-premises location. The only difference you'll notice in the UI is the words "On-Premises Deployment".

image:screenshot_compliance_onprem_notprem.png[A screenshot indicating a Cloud Compliance on-prem deployment versus a cloud deployment.]

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Subscribe to the Cloud Compliance service

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The first 1 TB of data that Cloud Compliance scans in Cloud Manager is free. A subscription to the AWS or Azure Marketplace is required to continue scanning data after that point.

== Creating a Connector

If you don't already have a Connector, create a Connector in Azure or AWS. See link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[creating a Connector in AWS^] or link:task_creating_connectors_azure.html[creating a Connector in Azure^]. In most cases you will probably have a Connector set up before you attempt to activate Cloud Compliance because most link:concept_connectors.html#when-a-connector-is-required[Cloud Manager features require a Connector], but there are cases when you need to set one up now.

There are some scenarios where you have to use a Connector in AWS or Azure for Cloud Compliance.

* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS or in AWS S3 buckets, you use a connector in AWS.
* When scanning data in Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure or in Azure NetApp Files, you use a connector in Azure.
* Databases and on-prem ONTAP systems can be scanned when using either Connector.

As you can see, there may be some situations where you need to use link:concept_connectors.html#when-to-use-multiple-connectors[multiple Connectors].

NOTE: If you are planning on scanning Azure NetApp Files, you need to make sure you're deploying in the same region as the volumes you wish to scan.

== Reviewing prerequisites

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you deploy Cloud Compliance.

Enable outbound internet access::
Cloud Compliance requires outbound internet access. If your virtual network uses a proxy server for internet access, ensure that the Cloud Compliance instance has outbound internet access to contact the following endpoints. Note that Cloud Manager deploys the Cloud Compliance instance in the same subnet as the Connector.

|===

Ensure that Cloud Manager has the required permissions::
Ensure that Cloud Manager has permissions to deploy resources and create security groups for the Cloud Compliance instance. You can find the latest Cloud Manager permissions in https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[the policies provided by NetApp^].

Check your vCPU limits::
Ensure that your cloud provider's vCPU limit allows for the deployment of an instance with 16 cores. You'll need to verify the vCPU limit for the relevant instance family in the region where Cloud Manager is running.
+
In AWS, the instance family is _On-Demand Standard instances_. In Azure, the instance family is _Standard Dsv3 Family_.
+
For more details on vCPU limits, see the following:
+
* https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-resource-limits.html[AWS documentation: Amazon EC2 Service Limits^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quotas[Azure documentation: Virtual machine vCPU quotas^]

Ensure that Cloud Manager can access Cloud Compliance::
Ensure connectivity between the Connector and the Cloud Compliance instance. The security group for the Connector must allow inbound and outbound traffic over port 80 to and from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
This connection enables deployment of the Cloud Compliance instance and enables you to view information in the Compliance tab.

Set up discovery of Azure NetApp Files::
Before you can scan volumes for Azure NetApp Files, link:task_manage_anf.html[Cloud Manager must be set up to discover the configuration^].

Ensure that you can keep Cloud Compliance running::
The Cloud Compliance instance needs to stay on to continuously scan your data.

Ensure web browser connectivity to Cloud Compliance::
After Cloud Compliance is enabled, ensure that users access the Cloud Manager interface from a host that has a connection to the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
The Cloud Compliance instance uses a private IP address to ensure that the indexed data isn't accessible to the internet. As a result, the web browser that you use to access Cloud Manager must have a connection to that private IP address. That connection can come from a direct connection to AWS or Azure (for example, a VPN), or from a host that's inside the same network as the Cloud Compliance instance.

== Deploying the Cloud Compliance instance in the cloud

You deploy an instance of Cloud Compliance for each Cloud Manager instance.

Deploying the instance in the cloud is the most common way to deploy Cloud Compliance. But you have the option to <<Deploying the Cloud Compliance instance on premises,deploy the Compliance software on a Linux host>> in your network or in the cloud.

The Compliance software functions exactly the same regardless of which installation method you choose.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, click *Compliance*.

. Click *Deploy Compliance in the Cloud* to start the deployment wizard.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_start.png[A screenshot of selecting the button to deploy Cloud Compliance in the cloud.]

. The wizard displays progress as it goes through the deployment steps. It will stop and ask for input if it runs into any issues.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_wizard_start.png[A screenshot of the Cloud Compliance wizard to deploy a new instance.]

. When the instance is deployed, click *Continue to configuration* to go to the _Scan Configuration_ page.

.Result

Cloud Manager deploys the Cloud Compliance instance in your cloud provider.

.What's Next
From the Scan Configuration page you can select the working environments, volumes, and buckets that you want to scan for compliance. You can also connect to a database server in order to scan specific database schemas. Activate Cloud Compliance on any of these data sources.

You can also <<Subscribing to the Cloud Compliance service,subscribe to the Cloud Compliance service>>. You will not be charged until the amount of data exceeds 1 TB.

== Deploying the Cloud Compliance instance on premises

The most common way to deploy Cloud Compliance is to <<Deploying the Cloud Compliance instance in the cloud,deploy it in the cloud>>. But you have the option to download and install the Compliance software on a Linux host in your network or in the cloud.

The Compliance software functions exactly the same regardless of which installation method you choose.

IMPORTANT: Cloud Compliance is currently unable to scan S3 buckets and ANF files if the Compliance instance is installed on premises.

.Requirements

* Operating system: Red Hat Enterprise Linux or CentOS version 8.0
** Version 7.8 can be used, but the Linux kernel version must be 4.14 or greater
** The OS must be capable of installing the docker engine (for example, disable the _firewalld_ service if needed)
* RAM: Minimum of 60 GB
* CPU: Minimum 8 CPU cores; 16 cores recommended
* Capacity: 500 GB

* A Red Hat Enterprise Linux system must be registered with Red Hat Subscription Management. If it is not registered, the system cannot access repositories to update required 3rd party software during installation.

*	Network connectivity between the host machine and the Connector over port 80. And make sure port 8080 is also open so you can see the installation progress in Cloud Manager.

See <<Reviewing prerequisites,Reviewing prerequisites>> for the list of endpoints that must be reachable from the host over the internet.

*Do we need any of these below that were listed in the Connector requirements?*
* The Compliance installer accesses several URLs during the installation process. You must ensure that outbound internet access is allowed to these endpoints:

** \http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-community-release-el7-5.noarch.rpm
** \https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
** \https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip
+
The host might try to update operating system packages during installation. The host can contact different mirroring sites for these OS packages.

.About this task

* Root privileges are not required to install Cloud Compliance.

* The installer that is available on the NetApp Support Site might be an earlier version. After installation, Cloud Compliance automatically updates itself whenever a newer version is available.

.Steps

. In Cloud Manager, click *Compliance*.

. Click *Deploy Compliance On Premises*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_compliance_deploy_onprem.png[A screenshot of selecting the button to deploy Cloud Compliance on premises.]

. In the _Deploying Cloud Compliance On Premises_ dialog:
.. Copy the provided command and paste it in a text file so you can use it later. For example:
+
 sudo ./install.sh -a 12345 -c 27AG75 -t 2198qq
+
.. Follow the steps from the link to install Compliance on a Linux host.

. Download the Cloud Compliance software from the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/cloud-compliance/downloads-tab[NetApp Support Site^], and then copy it to the Linux host.
+
For help with connecting and copying the file to:
+
* An EC2 instance in AWS, see http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html[AWS Documentation: Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH^].
* A VM in Azure, see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/copy-files-to-linux-vm-using-scp[Azure Documentation: Moving files to a Linux VM using SCP^].

. Unzip the installer file on the host machine:
+
 tar -xzf cc_onprem_installer.tar.gz

. When prompted to by the installer, enter the following information:
.. Paste the information you copied from step 3.
+
 sudo ./install.sh -a <account_id> -c <agent_id> -t <token>

.. Enter the IP address or host name of the Compliance host machine, as it will be accessed by the Connector instance.
.. Enter proxy details if needed. If your Cloud Manager already uses a proxy, there is no need to enter this information again here since Cloud Compliance will automatically use the proxy used by Cloud Manager:
+
 --proxy_host <proxy_host> --proxy_port <proxy_port> --proxy_scheme <proxy_scheme> --proxy_user <proxy_user> --proxy_password <proxy_password>
+
Alternatively, you can create the whole command in advance and input it in the first prompt:
+
 sudo ./install.sh -a <account_id> -c <agent_id> -t <token> --host <cc_host> --proxy_host <proxy_host> --proxy_port <proxy_port> --proxy_scheme <proxy_scheme> --proxy_user <proxy_user> --proxy_password <proxy_password>

Variable values:

* _account_id_ = NetApp Account ID
* _agent_id_ = Connector ID
* _token_ = jwt user token
* _cc_host_ = IP address or host name of the host Linux machine.
* _proxy_host_ IP or host name of the proxy server if the host is behind a proxy server.
* _proxy_port_ Port to connect to the proxy server (default 80).
* _proxy_user_ Authenticated user to connect to the proxy server, if basic authentication is required.
* _proxy_password_ Password for the user name that you specified.
* _proxy_scheme_ the connection schema: https or http (default http).

.Result

The Cloud Compliance installer installs packages, installs docker, registers the installation, downloads the Cloud Compliance artifact, and installs Cloud Compliance. Installation can take up to 10 minutes. If there is connectivity over port 8080 between the host machine and the Connector instance, you will see the installation progress in the Compliance tab in Cloud Manager.

.What's Next
From the Scan Configuration page you can select the working environments, volumes, and buckets that you want to scan for compliance. You can also connect to a database server in order to scan specific database schemas. Activate Cloud Compliance on any of these data sources.

You can also <<Subscribing to the Cloud Compliance service,subscribe to the Cloud Compliance service>>. You will not be charged until the amount of data exceeds 1 TB.

== Subscribing to the Cloud Compliance service

The first 1 TB of data that Cloud Compliance scans in a Cloud Manager workspace is free. A subscription to the AWS or Azure Marketplace is required to continue scanning data after that point. This is true even when you have deployed Cloud Compliance on an on-premises system.

You can subscribe at any time and you will not be charged until the amount of data exceeds 1 TB. You can always see the total amount of data that is being scanned from the Cloud Compliance Dashboard. And the _Subscribe Now_ button makes it easy to subscribe when you are ready.

image:screenshot_compliance_subscribe.png[A screenshot showing how much data is being scanned and the Subscribe button to subscribe to the service.]

*Note:* If you are prompted by Cloud Compliance to subscribe, but you already have an Azure subscription, you’re probably using the old *Cloud Manager* subscription and you need to change to the new *NetApp Cloud Manager* subscription. See <<Changing to the new Cloud Manager plan in Azure,Changing to the new NetApp Cloud Manager plan in Azure>> for details.

.Steps

These steps must be completed by a user who has the _Account Admin_ role.

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.
+
image:screenshot_settings_icon.gif[A screenshot of Cloud Manager's top right banner where you can select the Settings icon.]

. Find the credentials for the AWS Instance Profile or Azure Managed Service Identity.
+
The subscription must be added to the Instance Profile or Managed Service Identity. Charging won't work otherwise.
+
If you already have a subscription, then you're all set--there's nothing else that you need to do.
+
image:screenshot_profile_subscription.gif[A screenshot from the Credentials page that shows the Instance Profile with an active subscription.]

. If you don't have a subscription yet, hover over the credentials and click the action menu.

. Click *Add Subscription*.
+

== Changing to the new Cloud Manager plan in Azure

Cloud Compliance was added to the Azure Marketplace subscription named *NetApp Cloud Manager* as of October 7, 2020. If you already have the original Azure *Cloud Manager* subscription it will not allow you to use Cloud Compliance.

You need to follow these steps to select the new *NetApp Cloud Manager* subscription and then remove the old *Cloud Manager* subscription.

NOTE: If your existing Subscription was issued with a special private offer, you need to contact NetApp so that we can issue a new special private offer with Compliance included.

.Steps

These steps are similar to adding a new subscription as described above, but vary in a few places.

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. Find the credentials for the Azure Managed Service Identity that you want to change the subscription for and hover over the credentials and click *Associate Subscription*.
+
The details for your current Marketplace Subscription are displayed.

. Click *Add Subscription*, click *Continue*, and follow the steps. You are redirected to Azure portal in order to create the new subscription.

. Make sure you select the plan *NetApp Cloud Manager* that provides access to Cloud Compliance and not *Cloud Manager*.

. Go through the steps in the video to associate a Marketplace subscription to an Azure subscription:
+
video::video_subscribing_azure.mp4[width=848, height=480]

. Return to Cloud Manager, select the new subscription, and click *Associate*.

. To verify your subscription has changed, hover over the “i” above subscription in the Credentials card.
+
Now you can unsubscribe your old subscription from the Azure portal.

. In the Azure portal, go to Software as a Service (SaaS), select the subscription, and click *Unsubscribe*.
