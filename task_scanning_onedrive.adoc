A confirmation dialog displays the number of users who were added. If the dialog lists any users who could not be added, capture this information so that you can resolve the issue. In some cases you can re-add the user with a corrected email address.

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the files for the users you added.

== Removing OneDrive users from compliance scans

If users leave the company or if their email address changes, you can remove individual OneDrive users from having their files scanned at any time. Just click *Remove OneDrive User* from the Configuration page.
