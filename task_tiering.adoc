You can reduce storage costs in AWS and Azure by combining an SSD or HDD performance tier for "hot" data with an object storage capacity tier for "cold" data. For a high-level overview, see link:concept_storage.html#data-tiering[Data tiering].

To set up data tiering, you simply need to do the following:

image:diagram_tiering.gif[A diagram that shows the workflow for enabling tiering: choose a supported configuration, ensure that connectivity is available between tiers, and then choose a tiering policy when creating, modifying, or replicating a volume.]

[NOTE]
.What's not required for data tiering
====
* You do not need to install a feature license to enable data tiering.
* You do not need to create the capacity tier (either an S3 bucket or an Azure Blob container). Cloud Manager does that for you.

== Configurations that support data tiering

You can enable data tiering when using specific configurations and features:

* Data tiering is supported with ONTAP Cloud Standard, Premium, and BYOL, starting with ONTAP Cloud 9.2 for AWS and ONTAP Cloud 9.4 for Microsoft Azure.
+
NOTE: Data tiering is not supported in Azure with the DS3_v2 virtual machine type.

* Tiering policies are supported with the following licenses:
** Snapshot-only is supported with Standard, Premium, and BYOL.
** Backup is supported with Standard, Premium, and BYOL.
** Auto is supported with Premium and BYOL only.
+
For a description of these policies, see link:concept_storage.html#data-tiering[Data tiering].

* In AWS, the performance tier can be General Purpose SSDs, Provisioned IOPS SSDs, or Throughput Optimized HDDs.

* In Azure, the performance tier can be either Premium Storage (SSD) or Standard Storage (HDD).

* Data tiering is supported with AWS-managed encryption and Azure-managed encryption.
+
It is not supported with ONTAP Cloud-managed encryption.

* Thin provisioning must be enabled on volumes.

== Requirements for tiering data in AWS

You must ensure that ONTAP Cloud has a connection to S3. The best way to provide that connection is by creating a VPC Endpoint to the S3 service. For instructions, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpce-gateway.html#create-gateway-endpoint[AWS Documentation: Creating a Gateway Endpoint^].

When you create the VPC Endpoint, be sure to select the region, VPC, and route table that corresponds to the ONTAP Cloud instance. You must also modify the security group to add an outbound HTTPS rule that enables traffic to the S3 endpoint. Otherwise, ONTAP Cloud cannot connect to the S3 service.

If you experience any issues, see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/connect-s3-vpc-endpoint/[AWS Support Knowledge Center: Why canâ€™t I connect to an S3 bucket using a gateway VPC endpoint?^].

== Requirements for tiering data in Microsoft Azure

You do not need to set up a connection between the performance tier and the capacity tier as long as Cloud Manager has the required permissions. Cloud Manager enables a VNet service endpoint for you if the Cloud Manager policy has the appropriate permission:

"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",

That permission is included in the latest Cloud Manager policy. For details about providing permissions, see link:task_getting_started_azure.html#granting-azure-permissions-to-cloud-manager[Granting Azure Permissions to Cloud Manager].

== Tiering data on read-write volumes

ONTAP Cloud can tier cold data on read-write volumes to cost-effective object storage, freeing up the performance tier for hot data.

.Steps

. In the working environment, create a new volume or change the tier of an existing volume:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="30,70"]
|===

| Task
| Action

| Create a new volume	| Click *Add New Volume*.

| Modify an existing volume | Select the volume and click *Change Disk Type & Tiering Policy*.

|===

. Select the Snapshot Only policy or the Auto policy (supported only with ONTAP Cloud Premium or BYOL).
+
*Example*
+
image:screenshot_tiered_storage.gif[Screenshot that shows the icon to enable tiering to object storage.]
+
Cloud Manager creates a new aggregate for the volume if a data tiering-enabled aggregate does not already exist.
+
TIP: If you prefer to create aggregates yourself, you can enable data tiering on aggregates when you create them.

== Tiering data on data protection volumes

ONTAP Cloud can tier data from a data protection volume to a capacity tier. If you activate the destination volume, the data gradually moves to the performance tier as it is read.

.Steps

. On the Working Environments page, select the working environment that contains the source volume, and then drag it to the working environment to which you want to replicate the volume.

. Follow the prompts until you reach the tiering page and enable data tiering to object storage.
