Select one or more of the NetApp-provided "actions" and quickly build an application template that your organization can use to start optimizing the creation of resources.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify required prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Before users can create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files volume using a template, make sure they have access to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files Working Environment where the volume will be deployed.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* If you plan to add a Cloud service "action" to your template, such as link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup^], ensure that your environment has an active and licensed Cloud Backup service.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Launch the Application Templates service

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the *AppTemplate* service and select the template.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Build the template by selecting "actions" and defining parameters

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Follow the creation steps and define the actions that will be performed by the template.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration.

* If you don't already have a Connector, link:concept_connectors.html[see how to create Connectors^] for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

* When creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume template, make sure you have a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment available for your users. See how to launch a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in link:task_deploying_otc_aws.html[AWS^], link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[Azure^], or in link:task_deploying_gcp.html[GCP^].

* When creating an Azure NetApp Files volume template, make sure you have an Azure NetApp Files working environment available for your users. See how to link:task_manage_anf.html[create an Azure NetApp Files working environment^] in Cloud Manager.

* If you plan to enable Cloud Backup on Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes, ensure that your environment has an active and licensed Cloud Backup service.

* If you plan to enable Cloud Compliance on Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Azure NetApp Files volumes, ensure that your environment has an active and licensed Cloud Compliance service.

== Special template controls ==

Before you start creating your template, you should understand some special options that you can set when pre-populating a value for a parameter in a template.

image:screenshot_template_options.png[A screenshot of the editable and drift on options that you can set for parameter values.]

*Editable checkbox*

Check this box to let the storage admin override the pre-populated value you have entered in the template. This gives the storage admin a suggestion for what the value should be, but it allows them to customize the value when creating the resource.

When unchecked, the user can't change the value and the hard-coded value in the template is always used when the admin deploys a resource.

*Drift On checkbox*

Check this box so that Cloud Manager monitors the hard-coded value you entered for a parameter when a resource is created with the template. If Cloud Manager later sees that an admin has changed the parameter value so that it no longer aligns with the template definition, you will receive an email notification about the change.

When unchecked, the user can change the value to any value after the resource has been created.

By design, when drift is enabled (on) for a parameter value, the value is also not "editable" when the admin deploys a resource using the template.

*One additional thing to know about drift:*
For the drift feature to work, after you have defined drift for some parameters in the template, you must enable the drift feature for the template. This is the last step when creating a template. Drift doesn't work if it is enabled for a parameter but has not been enabled on the template.

*Using a regular expression (regex) in fields*

There are a few fields within templates that allow you to enter a regex to define the value that your admin can enter in the field; for example "Volume Name" and "Share Name".

image:screenshot_template_regex.png[A screenshot of using a regex to define the allowed values for a volume name.]

As an example, if you enter "^[a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z_]{0,149}$" as the regex for the volume name, it means that "_the name should start with an alphabetic character, it can contain only numbers, letters, or the underscore, and it should be 150 or fewer characters in length_".

== Passing values between template actions

Templates have the ability to use information from a previous action to populate a field in a future action. For example, when defining the name of the volume that will have Cloud Backup functionality enabled, you can instruct the Backup action to use the value the storage admin entered as the name of the volume from the Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP action.

There are two types of information that the AppTemplate service can use from previous actions:

* Input value - This is the actual value the storage admin entered into a field in a previous template action.
* Output value - This is the value Cloud Manager generates after creating a resource from a previous template action.

For example, to enable Compliance on a volume, the Cloud Compliance service needs both the "volume name" that the storage admin enters (the Input value), and the "volume uuid" that Cloud Manager generates when it creates the volume (the Output value).

The following illustration shows how to enter this information in the Cloud Compliance action section of the template.

image:screenshot_template_variable_input_output.png[An illustration showing how to use a value entered in a previous action to populate a field in another action.]
//
// The following illustration shows how to enter this information in the Backup action section of the template.
//
// image:screenshot_template_variable_input.png[An illustration showing how to use a value entered in a previous action to populate a field in another action.]
//
// At this time there are no use cases for selecting an "Output" operation, so the "Input" operation is the only option you can currently use.

== Creating a template for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume

See link:task_provisioning_storage.html#creating-flexvol-volumes[how to provision Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes^] for details about all the parameters you need to complete in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume template.

For this example we'll create a template named "CVO volume for databases" and include the following 2 actions:

*	Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP Volume
+
Make the volume for the AWS environment, configure it with 100 GB of storage, set the Snapshot Policy to "default", and enable Storage Efficiency.

*	Enable Cloud Backup
+
Create daily backups with a retention value of 30 copies.

See <<What to do after you have created the template,what you should tell your users about templates>>.

== What to do after you have created the template

After you have created a template, you should inform your storage administrators to use the template when creating new volumes.

Your users should select *Add Volume From Template* when adding a volume to a Working Environment in the future. The selection is available from the _Working Environment_ page, and from the _Volume Details_ page. See link:task_provisioning_storage.html#creating-volumes-from-templates[how to provision Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes^] or link:task_manage_anf_volumes.html#creating-volumes-from-templates[how to provision Azure NetApp Files volumes^] using templates.

image:screenshot_template_add_vol_from.png[Two screenshots showing how users can create new volumes from a template.]

== Editing and deleting a template

You can modify a template if you need to change any of the parameters. After you save your changes, all future resources created from the template will use the new parameter values.

You can also delete a template if you no longer need it. Deleting a template does not affect any of the resources that were created with the template.
