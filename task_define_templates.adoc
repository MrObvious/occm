Select one or more of the NetApp-provided "actions" and quickly build an application template that your organization can use to start optimizing the creation of resources.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify required prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* Before users can create a volume for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, or Azure NetApp Files system using a template, make sure they have access to an appropriate working environment where the volume will be deployed.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* If you plan to add a Cloud service "action" to your template, such as link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup^] or link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense^], ensure that the service is active and licensed in your environment.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Launch the Application Templates service

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the *AppTemplate* service, click the *Editor* tab, and select the template.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Build the template by selecting "actions" and defining parameters

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Follow the creation steps and define the actions that will be performed by the template.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration.

* If you don't already have a Connector, link:concept_connectors.html[see how to create Connectors^] for AWS, Azure, and GCP.

* When creating a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume template, make sure you have a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment available for your users. See how to launch a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in link:task_deploying_otc_aws.html[AWS^], link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[Azure^], or in link:task_deploying_gcp.html[GCP^].

* When creating an on-premises ONTAP volume template, make sure you have an on-premises ONTAP working environment available for your users. See how to link:task_discovering_ontap.html[discover an on-premises ONTAP system^] in Cloud Manager.

* When creating an Azure NetApp Files volume template, make sure you have an Azure NetApp Files working environment available for your users. See how to link:task_manage_anf.html[create an Azure NetApp Files working environment^] in Cloud Manager.

* If you plan to enable Cloud Backup in the template, ensure that your environment has an active and licensed Cloud Backup service.

* If you plan to enable Cloud Data Sense in the template, ensure that your environment has an active and licensed Cloud Data Sense service.

* If you plan to enable Replication in the template, and the template is for an on-premises ONTAP volume, the ONTAP cluster must have an active SnapMirror license.

== Examples of creating resources using templates

Resource templates enable you to create new volumes or a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment.

=== Create a template for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume

See link:task_provisioning_storage.html#creating-flexvol-volumes[how to provision Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes^] for details about all the parameters you need to complete in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume template.

For this example we'll create a template named "CVO volume for databases" and include the following 2 actions:

*	Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP Volume
+
Make the volume for the AWS environment, configure it with 100 GB of storage, set the Snapshot Policy to "default", and enable Storage Efficiency.

*	Enable Cloud Backup
+
Create daily backups with a retention value of 30 copies.

.Steps

. Select the *AppTemplate* service, click the *Templates* tab, and click *Add New Template*.
+
The _Select_a Template_ page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_create_template_primary_action_cvo.png[A screenshot showing how to select the primary action that will be performed using this template.]

+
The _Create Volume in Cloud Volumes ONTAP Action Definition_ page is displayed.
+
image:screenshot_create_template_define_action_cvo.png[A screenshot showing a blank CVO template that you need to fill in.]

. *Action Name*: Optionally, enter a customized action name instead of the default value.

. *Context:* Enter the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment context; if required.
+
When users launch the template from an existing working environment, this information gets filled in automatically.
+
When users launch the template from the Templates Dashboard (not in a working environment context), then they need to select the working environment and the SVM where the volume will be created. That's why these fields are marked as "Editable".

. *Details:* Enter the volume name and size.
+
[cols=2*,options="header",cols="25,75"]

|===
| Field
| Description

| Volume Name | Click in the field and select one of the 5 options. You can let the admin enter any name by selecting *Free Text*, or you can specify that the volume name must have a certain prefix or suffix, that it _contains_ certain characters, or that it follows rules from a regular expression (regex) you enter.

For example, you could specify that "db" be a required prefix, suffix, or contains; requiring the user to add volume names like "db_vol1", "vol1_db", or "vol_db_1".

| Volume Size | You can specify a range of allowable values, or you can specify a fixed size. This value is in GB. For our example we can add a fixed value *100*.

| Tags | Enter a name and value pair for a tag that you want to associate with this volume. For example, you could add "Cost Center" as the tag name and the cost center code "6655829" as the value. You can associate more than one tag with a volume by adding more tag name and value pairs.

== Examples of enabling services using templates

Service templates enable you to activate Cloud Backup, Cloud Data Sense, or Replication (SnapMirror) services on a newly created volume.

=== Add Backup functionality to a volume

When creating a volume template, you can add in the template that you want to create backups of the volume periodically using the link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html[Cloud Backup] service. This action is not applicable for Azure NetApp Files volumes.

image:screenshot_template_backup.png[A screenshot of the page to enable backup functionality for your volumes.]

. *Context:* You can enter a working environment Name and storage VM name if you are using this action in a template without first creating a volume. Otherwise, leave these fields as "Editable."

. *Policy:* Define the backup policy to create daily, weekly, or monthly backups with a specific number of backup copies to retain.

. *Volume Name:* Typically the volume is the one created prior to the backup action in the same template. In this case, see how to <<Pass values between template actions,complete the fields>> within the volume name to indicate that volume.

. Click *Apply* to save your changes.

=== Add Data Sense functionality to a volume

When creating a volume template, you can add in the template that you want to scan the volume for compliance and classification using the link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Cloud Data Sense] service.

image:screenshot_template_data_sense.png[A screenshot of the page to enable scanning functionality for your volumes.]

. *Context:* You can enter a working environment Name if you are using this action in a template without first creating a volume. Otherwise, leave this field as "Editable."

. *Volume Name:* Typically the volume is the one created prior to the Data Sense action in the same template. In this case, see how to <<Pass values between template actions,complete the fields>> within the volume name to indicate that volume.

. *Volume UUID:* Data Sense needs the UUID of the volume before it can scan the volume. See how to <<Pass values between template actions,complete the three fields>> below the volume name to indicate that volume.

. Click *Apply* to save your changes.

=== Add Replication functionality to a volume

When creating a volume template, you can add in the template that you want to replicate the data in the volume to another volume using the link:concept_replication.html[Replication] service. You can replicate data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster or to an on-prem ONTAP cluster.

TIP: This action is not applicable for Azure NetApp Files volumes.

Replication functionality consists of three parts: selecting the source volume, selecting the destination volume, and defining the replication settings. Each section is described below.

. *Source Details:* Enter the details about the source volume you want to replicate:
+
image:screenshot_template_replication_source.png[A screenshot of the page to define the replication source volume location.]
+
.. Select the working environment where the volume resides.
.. Select the storage VM on which the volume resides.
.. Typically the volume is the one created prior to the replication action in the same template. In this case, see how to <<Pass values between template actions,complete the fields>> within the Source Volume Name field to indicate that volume.
.. Replication requires that the source and destination working environments are connected through their intercluster LIFs. Enter the intercluster LIF IP address for the source working environment.
+
To get this information: double-click the working environment, click the menu icon, and click Information.

. *Destination Details:* Enter the details about the destination volume that will be created by the replication operation:
+
image:screenshot_template_replication_dest.png[A screenshot of the page to define the replication destination volume location.]
+
.. Select the working environment where the volume will be created.
.. Select the storage VM on which the volume will reside.
.. Select the aggregate on which the volume will reside.
.. For the destination volume, click in the field and select one of the 5 options. You can let the admin enter any name by selecting *Free Text*, or you can specify that the volume name must have a certain prefix or suffix, that it _contains_ certain characters, or that it follows rules from a regular expression (regex) you enter.
.. Replication requires that the source and destination working environments are connected through their intercluster LIFs. Enter the intercluster LIF IP address for the destination working environment.
.. When replicating a volume to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP cluster (not to an on-prem ONTAP cluster), you need to specify the Destination Provider (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and the type of disk that will be used for the new volume.

. *Replication Details:* Enter the details about the type and frequency of the replication operation:
+
image:screenshot_template_replication_policy.png[A screenshot of the page to define the replication settings for the relationship.]
+
.. Enter the maximum rate (in kilobytes per second) at which data can be transferred. You can enter a fix value, or you can provide a minimum and maximum and let the storage admin select a value in that range.
.. Select the link:concept_replication_policies.html#types-of-replication-policies[replication policy] that you want to use.
.. Choose a one-time copy or a recurring replication schedule.

. Click *Apply* to save your changes.

== What to do after you have created the template

After you have created a template, you should inform your storage administrators to use the template when creating new volumes.

You can point them to link:task_run_templates.html[Creating resources using templates] for details.

== Edit or delete a template

You can modify a template if you need to change any of the parameters. After you save your changes, all future resources created from the template will use the new parameter values.

You can also delete a template if you no longer need it. Deleting a template does not affect any of the resources that were created with the template. However, no Drift compliance checking can be done after the template is deleted.
