== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration.

Supported Cloud Volumes ONTAP versions::

Supported Connector::
* For

Networking for the Connector::
Similar to the Acquisition Unit, the Connector must have outbound connectivity to the Cloud Insights tenant. But the endpoint that the Connector contacts is slightly different. It contacts the tenant host URL using the shortened tenant ID:

 https://<your-short-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>

For example:

Again, you can contact us through the in-product chat if you need help identifying the tenant host URL.
