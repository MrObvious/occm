Connectors should remain running at all times. They are important for the continued health and operation of the services that you enable.

For example, a Connector is a key component in the health and operation of Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems. If a Connector is powered down, Cloud Volumes ONTAP PAYGO systems will shut down after losing communication with a Connector for longer than 14 days.
