Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Amazon S3.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You're running Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 or later in AWS.
* You have subscribed to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[Cloud Manager Marketplace Backup offering^], or you have purchased link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[and activated^] a Cloud Backup BYOL license from NetApp.
* The IAM role that provides Cloud Manager with permissions includes S3 permissions from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy^].

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Enable Cloud Backup on your new or existing system

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* New systems: Cloud Backup is enabled by default in the working environment wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

* Existing systems: Select the working environment and click *Enable* next to the Backup & Restore service in the right-panel, and then follow the setup wizard.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Define the backup policy

[role="quick-margin-para"]
The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. Change to weekly or monthly backups, or select one of the system-defined policies that provide more options. You can also change the number of backup copies to retain.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Identify which volumes you want to back up in the Select Volumes page.

==== image:number6.png[Number 6] Restore your data, as needed

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Choose to restore an entire backup to a new volume, or to restore individual files from the backup to an existing volume. You can restore data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in AWS, or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
See link:task_restore_backups.html[Restoring volume data from backup files^] for details.

== Requirements

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to S3.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them:

image:diagram_cloud_backup_cvo_aws.png[A diagram showing how Cloud Backup communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

Supported ONTAP versions::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 and later.

Supported AWS regions::
Cloud Backup is supported in all AWS regions https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[where Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported^].

License requirements::
For Cloud Backup PAYGO licensing, a Cloud Manager subscription is available in the AWS Marketplace that enables deployments of Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 and later (PAYGO) and Cloud Backup. You need to https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[subscribe to this Cloud Manager subscription^] before you enable Cloud Backup. Billing for Cloud Backup is done through this subscription.
+
For Cloud Backup BYOL licensing, you do not need an AWS Cloud Backup subscription. You need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. See link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[Adding and updating your Backup BYOL license^].
+
And you need to have a AWS subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.

AWS permissions required::
The IAM role that provides Cloud Manager with permissions must include S3 permissions from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy^].
+
Here are the specific permissions from the policy:
+
[source,json]
{
            "Sid": "backupPolicy",
            "Effect": "Allow",

                "s3:PutLifecycleConfiguration",
                "s3:PutBucketTagging",
                "s3:ListBucketVersions",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
