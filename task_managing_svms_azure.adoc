A storage VM is a virtual machine running within ONTAP that provides storage and data services to your clients. You might know this as an _SVM_ or a _vserver_. Cloud Volumes ONTAP is configured with one storage VM by default, but additional storage VMs are supported when running Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure.

To create additional data-serving storage VMs, you need to allocate IP addresses in Azure, set up the load balancer for an HA pair, and then run ONTAP commands to create the storage VM and data LIFs.

== Supported number of storage VMs

Multiple storage VMs are supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL in Azure with an add-on license starting with the 9.9.0 release. Go to the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/index.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^] to verify the supported number of storage VMs for your version of Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

All other Cloud Volumes ONTAP configurations support one data-serving storage VM and one destination storage VM used for disaster recovery. You can activate the destination storage VM for data access if there's an outage on the source storage VM.

== Allocate IP addresses in Azure

IP addresses must be assigned to nic0 in Azure before you create a storage VM and allocate LIFs.

You'll need to create an IP address for data LIF access from node 1, another IP address for data LIF access from node 2 (HA pairs only), and another optional IP address for a storage VM (SVM) management LIF. This management LIF provides a connection to management tools like SnapCenter.

.Steps

. Log in to the Azure portal and open the *Virtual machine* service.

. Click the name of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP VM.

. Click *Networking*.

. Click the name of the network interface for nic0.

. Under *Settings*, click *IP configurations*.

. Click *Add*.

. Enter a name for the IP configuration, select *Static*, and then click *OK*.

. If you have an HA pair, repeat these steps on node 2.

. If you want to create an SVM management LIF, repeat these steps on node 1.

.After you finish

Copy the private IP addresses that you just created. You'll need to specify those IP addresses when you create LIFs for the new storage VM.

== Modify the load balancer for an HA pair

If you have an HA pair, you need to modify the load balancer so that the IP addresses can migrate to the other node in case failover events occur.

.Steps

. In the Azure portal, open the *Load balancers* service.

. Click the name of the load balancer for the HA pair.

. Create one frontend IP configuration for data LIF access from node 1, another for data LIF access from node 2 (HA pairs only), and another optional frontend IP for a storage VM (SVM) management LIF.

.. Under *Settings*, click *Frontend IP configuration*.

.. Click *Add*.

.. Enter a name for the frontend IP, select the default subnet, and leave *Dynamic* selected.
+

. Add a health probe for each frontend IP that you just created.

.. Under the load balancer's *Settings*, click *Health probes*.

.. Click *Add*.

.. Enter a name for the health probe and enter a port number that's between 63005 and 63500. Keep the default values for the other fields.
+
It's important that the port number is between 63005 and 63500. For example, if you are creating three health probes, you could enter probes that use the port numbers 63005, 63006, and 63007.

. Create new load balancing rules for each frontend IP.

.. Under the load balancer's *Settings*, click *Load balancing rules*.

.. Click *Add* and enter the required information:
+
* *Name*: Enter a name for the rule.
* *IP Version*: Select *IPv4*.
* *Frontend IP address*: Select one of the frontend IP addresses that you just created.
* *HA Ports*: Enable this option.
* *Backend pool*: Keep the default Backend pool that was already selected.
* *Health probe*: Select one of the health probes that you just created.
* *Session persistence*: Select *None*.
* *Floating IP*: Select *Enabled*.

.After you finish

Ensure that the network security group rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP allows the load balancer to send TCP probes for the health probes that were created in step 4 above. Note that this is allowed by default.

== Create a storage VM

These steps create a new storage VM on a single node system or on an HA pair. One IP address is required for data LIF access from node 1, another IP address for data LIF access from node 2 (HA pairs only), and another optional IP address for a storage VM (SVM) management LIF. This management LIF provides a connection to management tools like SnapCenter.

.Steps

. Create the storage VM and a route to the storage VM.
+
[source,cli]
vserver create -vserver <svm-name> -subtype default -rootvolume <root-volume-name> -rootvolume-security-style mixed
+
[source,cli]
network route create -destination 0.0.0.0/0 -vserver <svm-name> -gateway <ip-of-gateway-server>

. Create a NAS LIF on node 1.
+
[source,cli]
network interface create -vserver <svm-name> -lif <lif-name> -role data -data-protocol cifs,nfs,fcache -address <nfs-cifs-ip-address> -netmask-length 24 -home-node <name-of-node1> -status-admin up -failover-policy system-defined -firewall-policy data -home-port e0a -auto-revert true -failover-group Default -probe-port <port-number-for-azure-health-probe1>

. Create a NAS LIF on node 2 (for HA pairs only).
+
[source,cli]
network interface create -vserver <svm-name> -lif <lif-name> -role data -data-protocol cifs,nfs,fcache -address <nfs-cifs-ip-address> -netmask-length 24 -home-node <name-of-node2> -status-admin up -failover-policy system-defined -firewall-policy data -home-port e0a -auto-revert true -failover-group Default -probe-port <port-number-for-azure-health-probe2>

. Optional: Create a storage VM management LIF on node 1.
+
[source,cli]
network interface create -vserver <svm-name> -lif <lif-name> -role data -data-protocol cifs,nfs,fcache -address <svm-mgmt-ip-address> -netmask-length 24 -home-node node1 -status-admin up -failover-policy system-defined -firewall-policy data -home-port e0a -auto-revert true -failover-group Default -probe-port <port-number-for-azure-health-probe3>
