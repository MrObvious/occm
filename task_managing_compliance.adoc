If you need to, you can stop Cloud Data Sense from scanning one or more working environments, databases, file share groups, or OneDrive accounts. You can also delete the Cloud Data Sense instance if you no longer want to use Cloud Data Sense with your working environments.

== Deactivating compliance scans for a working environment

When you deactivate scans, Cloud Data Sense no longer scans the data on the working environment and it removes the indexed compliance insights from the Data Sense instance (the data from the working environment itself isn't deleted).

. From the _Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the working environment, and then click *Deactivate Scanning*.
