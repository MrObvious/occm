If you need to, you can stop Cloud Compliance from scanning one or more working environments, databases, or OneDrive accounts. You can also delete the Cloud Compliance instance if you no longer want to use Cloud Compliance with your working environments.

== Deactivating compliance scans for a working environment

When you deactivate scans, Cloud Compliance no longer scans the data on the working environment and it removes the indexed compliance insights from the Cloud Compliance instance (the data from the working environment itself isn't deleted).

. From the _Scan Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the working environment, and then click *Deactivate Compliance*.

TIP: You can also disable compliance scans for a working environment from the Services panel when you select the working environment.

== Removing a database from Cloud Compliance

If you no longer want to scan a certain database, you can delete it from the Cloud Compliance interface and stop all scans.

. From the _Scan Configuration_ page, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button in the row for the database, and then click *Remove DB Server*.
