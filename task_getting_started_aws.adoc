Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a few steps.

These steps assume that you're creating your first working environment, that you haven't created a Connector yet, and that you'll create the Connector in AWS directly from Cloud Manager (see the at the end of the page for alternatives).

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Plan your configuration

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager offers preconfigured packages that match your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you. link:task_planning_your_config_azure.html[Learn more].

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Provide the required AWS permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you create a Connector from Cloud Manager, you need to use an AWS account that has permissions to deploy the instance.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Go to the AWS IAM console and create a policy by copying and pasting the contents of the https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Connector IAM policy for AWS^].

.. Attach the policy to the IAM user.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC so the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.
+
This step is important because the Connector can't manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_aws.html[the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

.. Set up a VPC endpoint to the S3 service.
+
A VPC endpoint is required if you want to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Set up the AWS KMS

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you want to use Amazon encryption with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you need to ensure that an active Customer Master Key (CMK) exists. You also need to modify the key policy for each CMK by adding the IAM role that provides permissions to the Connector as a _key user_. link:task_setting_up_kms.html[Learn more].

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Add Working Environment*, select the type of system that you would like to deploy, and complete the steps in the wizard. link:task_deploying_otc.html[Read step-by-step instructions].
