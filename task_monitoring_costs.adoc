Cloud Manager enables you to view the costs associated with running Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS. You can also see how much money you saved by using NetApp features that can reduce storage costs.

.About this task

Cloud Manager updates the storage and compute costs every 12 hours. You should refer to AWS for final cost details.

.Step

. On the Working Environments page, select a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and then click *Cost*.
+
The Cost page displays costs for the current and previous months and shows your storage costs savings, if you enabled NetApp's efficiency features on volumes. If the cost information is not available, verify that the Cloud Manager Admin met the prerequisites listed earlier.
