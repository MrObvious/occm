Get started with Amazon FSx for ONTAP in a few steps.

== Quick start

Get started with FSx for ONTAP in a few steps.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Create an FSx for ONTAP working environment

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You must create an Amazon FSx for ONTAP working environment before adding volumes.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Create a Connector

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Create a Connector for AWS using an AWS access key and secret key for an IAM user with the required FSx for ONTAP permissions.  If you don't have a link:concept_connectors.html[Connector], an Account Admin needs to create one. If you already have a Connector in AWS, you can attach FSx for ONTAP permissions to the IAM role for the Connector or create a new IAM role with required permissions.  link:task_creating_connectors_aws.html[Learn how to create a Connector in AWS^].

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Add or discover volumes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Volumes that already exist in the FSx for ONTAP file system appear in the new working environment. Otherwise you can create new volumes from Cloud Manager.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Manage your volumes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Use Cloud Manager to manage your volumes and configure additional services such as replication, Cloud Sync, and Data Sense.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that your VPC and subnets will support connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Your VPC should have subnets available in at least in two availability zones to ensure each cluster node is in a dedicated availability zone.

.. Floating IP addresses are required for cluster and SVM and for NFS and CIFS data access. You can optionally specify a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. To access data from outside the VPC, you can set up an link:https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway[AWS transit gateway].

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VPC so the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.
+
This step is important because the Connector can't manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_aws.html[the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

.. Set up a VPC endpoint to the S3 service.
+
A VPC endpoint is required if you want to tier cold data from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to low-cost object storage.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Set up the AWS KMS

[role="quick-margin-para"]
If you want to use Amazon encryption with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you need to ensure that an active Customer Master Key (CMK) exists. You also need to modify the key policy for each CMK by adding the IAM role that provides permissions to the Connector as a _key user_. link:task_setting_up_kms.html[Learn more].

==== image:number5.png[Number 5] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Add Working Environment*, select the type of system that you would like to deploy, and complete the steps in the wizard. link:task_deploying_otc_aws.html[Read step-by-step instructions].
