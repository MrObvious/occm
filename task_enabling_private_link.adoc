By default, Cloud Manager enables an Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts. A Private Link secures connections between endpoints in Azure. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-overview[Learn more^].

In most cases, there’s nothing that you need to do--Cloud Manager manages the Azure Private Link for you. But if you use a private DNS server, then you’ll need to edit a configuration file. You can also disable the Private Link connection, if desired.

== Providing Cloud Manager with details about your private DNS server

If you use your own private DNS server in Azure and not the default Microsoft DNS server, then you need to modify a configuration file on each Connector. Otherwise, Cloud Manager can't enable the Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and its associated storage accounts.

Note that the DNS name of the private DNS server must match Azure DNS naming requirements https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-private-endpoints#dns-changes-for-private-endpoints[as shown in Azure documentation^].

.Steps

. SSH to the Connector host and log in.

. Navigate to the following directory: /opt/application/netapp/cloudmanager

. Edit app.conf by modifying the following parameter as shown:
+
 "user-private-dns-zone-settings": {
    "use-existing": true,
    "resource-group": "<resource group name of the DNS zone>"
   }

. Save the file and log off the Connector.
+
A reboot isn't required.

== Disabling Azure Private Link connections

If required for your Azure configuration, you can disable the Azure Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and storage accounts.

.Steps

.	In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Settings icon, and select *Cloud Manager Settings*.

.	Under Azure Cloud Volumes ONTAP Configuration, deselect *Private Link connection between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and storage accounts*.

.	Click *Save*.
