Cloud Backup enables you to create backup files in an AWS account that is different than where your source volumes reside. And both of those accounts can be different than the account where the Cloud Manager Connector resides.

Just follow the steps below to set up configuration in this manner.

== Set up VPC peering between accounts

. Log in to second account and Create Peering Connection:
.. Select a local VPC: Select the VPC of the second account.
.. Select another VPC: Enter the account ID of the first account.
.. Select the Region where the Cloud Manager Connector is running. In this test setup both accounts are running in same region.
.. VPC ID: Log into first account and enter the acceptor VPC ID. This is the VPC ID of the Cloud Manager Connector.

The connection now shows as Active. We have also added a Name tag to identify the peering connection called `cbs-multi-account`.
