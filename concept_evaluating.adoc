You can evaluate Cloud Volumes ONTAP before you pay for the software.

A 30-day free trial of a single-node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is available from https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central]. There are no hourly software charges for that instance, but AWS infrastructure charges still apply. A free trial automatically converts to a paid hourly subscription when it expires.

If you need assistance with your proof of concept, contact https://cloud.netapp.com/contact-cds[the Sales team^] or reach out through the chat option available from https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central] and from within Cloud Manager.
