You can evaluate Cloud Volumes ONTAP before you pay for the software.

You can start a 30-day free trial of a single-node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system from https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central]. There are no hourly software charges for that instance, but AWS infrastructure charges still apply. A free trial automatically converts to a paid hourly subscription when it expires.

If you need assistance with your proof of concept, contact NetApp Sales by using the chat option from https://cloud.netapp.com[NetApp Cloud Central^].
