Each Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system must have a system license installed with an active subscription. Cloud Manager simplifies the process by managing licenses for you and by notifying you before they expire. BYOL licenses are also available for Cloud Backup.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/index.html[Refer to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes for additional licensing options^].

== BYOL system licenses

You can purchase multiple licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system to allocate more than 368 TB of capacity. For example, you might purchase two licenses to allocate up to 736 TB of capacity to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Or you could purchase four licenses to get up to 1.4 PB.

The number of licenses that you can purchase for a single node system or HA pair is unlimited.

NOTE: Some on-premises ONTAP storage systems that you purchased may have included a free Cloud Volumes ONTAP license. You can use the license to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, or you can apply the license to an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system to expand the capacity. link:task_managing_ontap.html#viewing-unused-cloud-volumes-ontap-licenses[See if you have any available licenses to use^].

Be aware that disk limits can prevent you from reaching the capacity limit by using disks alone. You can go beyond the disk limit by link:concept_data_tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage]. For information about disk limits, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-volumes-ontap/[storage limits in the Cloud Volumes ONTAP Release Notes^].

=== License management for a new system

When you create a BYOL system, Cloud Manager prompts you for the serial number of your license and your NetApp Support Site account. Cloud Manager uses the account to download the license file from NetApp and to install it on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

link:task_adding_nss_accounts.html[Learn how to add NetApp Support Site accounts to Cloud Manager].

If Cloud Manager can't access the license file over the secure internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager. For instructions, see link:task_managing_licenses.html[Managing BYOL licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== License expiration warning

Cloud Manager warns you 30 days before a license is due to expire and again when the license expires. The following image shows a 30-day expiration warning:

You can select the working environment to review the message.

If you don't renew the license in time, the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system shuts itself down. If you restart it, it shuts itself down again.

NOTE: Cloud Volumes ONTAP can also notify you through email, an SNMP traphost, or syslog server using EMS (Event Management System) event notifications. For instructions, see the http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.exp-ems/home.html[ONTAP 9 EMS Configuration Express Guide^].

=== License renewal

When you renew a BYOL subscription by contacting a NetApp representative, Cloud Manager automatically obtains the new license from NetApp and installs it on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

If Cloud Manager can't access the license file over the secure internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager. For instructions, see link:task_managing_licenses.html[Managing BYOL licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

=== License transfer to a new system

A BYOL license is transferable between Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems when you delete an existing system and then create a new one using the same license.

For example, you might want to delete an existing licensed system and then use the license with a new BYOL system in a different VPC/VNet or cloud provider. Note that only _cloud-agnostic_ serial numbers work in any cloud provider. Cloud-agnostic serial numbers start with the _908xxxx_ prefix.

It's important to note that your BYOL license is tied to your company and a specific set of NetApp Support Site credentials.

== BYOL backup licenses

A BYOL backup license allows you to purchase a license from NetApp to use Cloud Backup for a certain period of time and for a maximum amount backup space. When either limit is reached you will need to renew the license.
