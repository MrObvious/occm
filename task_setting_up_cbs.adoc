The NetApp Cloud Backup Service for Cloud Volumes ONTAP delivers fully-managed backup and restore capabilities for protection and long-term archive of your cloud data. Install and configure the backup agent and then run commands to start backup and restore operations.

Integrating the Cloud Backup Service with Cloud Volumes ONTAP is supported in AWS only.

https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-backup-service[Learn more about the Cloud Backup Service^].

== Installing and configuring the Cloud Backup Service agent

We recommend that you install the backup agent on the Cloud Manager instance. An internet connection is required to download the agent package and a connection to Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems is required for backup and restore operations. The Cloud Manager instance should meet both of those requirements.

=== Downloading the agent package

Download the agent package from an S3 bucket and uncompress the files to a directory on the instance.

.Steps

. Log in to the Cloud Manager EC2 instance.

. Download the agent for the Cloud Backup Service:
+
https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/cbs-package-bucket/packages/cvo-cbs-agent-0.1.tgz

. Untar the compressed files into a directory.

=== Creating VPC interface endpoints to the Cloud Backup Service

Two VPC interface endpoints are required to communicate with the Cloud Backup Service.

.Steps

. At the AWS CLI, run `aws configure` and provide your secret key and access key.

. Run the following command to create a VPC interface endpoint to the backup service:
+
`aws --region <region> cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <stack-name> --template-body \file://vpc_endpont.json --parameters ParameterKey=VPCId,ParameterValue=<vpc-id> ParameterKey=SubnetId,ParameterValue=<subnet-id> ParameterKey=ServiceCbs,ParameterValue=com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-2.vpce-svc-08431eb3daaa09a3c ParameterK`
+
* The _region_, _VPC ID_, and _subnet ID_ should correspond to the network location where your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems are deployed. You can list multiple subnets if your systems are deployed across different subnets.
* The _stack name_ can be any string that identifies the purpose of the CFT.
* The _template body_ specifies the location of the Cloud Formation Template that was included in the agent package that you downloaded and uncompressed to a directory.

. Now run the following command to create a VPC interface endpoint to the restore service:
+
`aws --region <region> cloudformation create-stack --stack-name <stack-name> --template-body \file://vpc_endpont.json --parameters ParameterKey=VPCId,ParameterValue=<vpc-id> ParameterKey=SubnetId,ParameterValue=<subnet-id> ParameterKey=ServiceCbs,ParameterValue=com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-2.vpce-svc-0b88382c75c97e1f5 ParameterK`
+
The only difference between this command and the previous command is the value of the _ServiceCbs_ parameter, which now identifies the endpoint of the restore service.

=== Generating a user token for authentication

Each backup and restore operation requires a user token for authentication.

.Steps

. https://services.cloud.netapp.com/developer-hub[Go to the API Documentation for NetApp Cloud Central^].

. Click *Learn how to authenticate*.

. Follow the instructions to generate an access token using regular access or federated access, while making a few changes to the body so it works for the Cloud Backup Service.

.. For regular access, use the following audience and client_id:
+
[source,curl]
"audience": "https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com",
"client_id": "820mpid46qcYuASSisUtyAPNznO4rSy4"

.. For federated access, use the following audience:
+
[source,curl]
"audience": "https://cloudmanager.cloud.netapp.com",

. After you receive the token, copy the value into the _user_token.json_ file by overwriting the existing value.
+
You can find this file in the same directory where you uncompressed the agent package.
+
NetApp Cloud Central uses the token to authenticate the user for all API calls between Cloud Volumes ONTAP and the Cloud Backup Service. If the token is invalid or expired, the API calls will fail and backup and restore operations will not start.

=== Configuring the Cloud Backup Service agent

Modify the agent's configuration file by specifying the IP addresses of the network interfaces for the VPC endpoints. This enables the agent to contact the Cloud Backup Service.

.About this task

If you update this configuration file after you start the agent, you'll need to kill the service and then restart it. See <<Updating the config.json file>>.

.Steps

. Go to the directory where you uncompressed the agent package.

. Edit the _config.json_ file by specifying the IP addresses.
+
[source,json]
{
          "LRSE_BACKUP_IP": "<ENI private IP for backup>",
          "LRSE_RESTORE_IP": "<ENI private IP for restore>",
          "CBS_ENDPOINT_IP" : "<ENI private IP for backup>",
          "CBS_ENDPOINT_PORT" : "8888",
          "SNAPMIRROR_POLICY_TRIES": 8,
          "SNAPMIRROR_RETRY_COUNT": 10,
          "SNAPMIRROR_POLL_INTERVAL":30
}
+
* LRSE_BACKUP_IP is the private IP address of the VPC interface endpoint that's connected to the backup service. You can find the IP address in the AWS console. First, go to the VPC service and  select the VPC Endpoint's network interface (ENI) that corresponds to the subnet of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. Then go to the EC2 service and view the network interface to obtain its private IP address.
+
image:screenshot_aws_endpoint_service.gif[A screenshot of the AWS VPC Console that shows the network interfaces for a VPC Endpoint.]

* LRSE_RESTORE_IP is the private IP address of the VPC interface endpoint that's connected to the restore service. Follow the same instructions provided for LRSE_BACKUP_IP.

* CBS_ENDPOINT_IP should be the same as the LRSE_BACKUP_IP since we use the same VPC interface endpoint for making API calls.

.What if I'm backing multiple Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems?
****
It's okay to use the same IP addresses for multiple Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, as long as the subnets are in the same Availability Zone. If you need to back up multiple systems that are spread across Availability Zones, contact us using the in-product chat and we'll help you with your setup.
****

=== Starting the Cloud Backup Service agent

Now that you've installed and configured the agent, you need to start it.

.Steps

. Run the following commands:
+
`chmod +x cvo-cbs-service`
`chmod +x cvo-cbs-client`
`./cvo-cbs-service &`

== Preparing to back up and restore volumes

When you run a backup or restore operation, you need to specify a JSON file that includes information about the volume. You can use a JSON template to prepare a JSON file for each volume.

=== Preparing ad hoc backups

An ad hoc backup is an immediate, one-time backup. Prepare a separate JSON file for each volume that you want to backup.

.Steps

. Create a copy of _adhoc_backup.json_ and edit it by providing details about the volume.
+
[source,json]
{
       "ownerId": "e7855e3e-006d-49f0-bd1e-2c0df8fec505",
       "ontapIP": "10.193.78.9",
       "username": "admin",
       "password": "netapp1!",
       "vserverName": "vs_seeni",
       "volumeName": "backup",
       "fileSystemId": "cf765c5f-84e6-4080-84a7-599ab8a31968",
       "sourceSnapshot": "snap10",
       "tag": ""
}
+
* ownerId: A unique identifier of the volume owner where the volume information can be retrieved. This is used for billing. Run the "uuidgen" UNIX utility to generate an ID.
* ontapIP: The cluster management IP of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system where the volume is located. Get this value from Cloud Manager by selecting the system from the Working Environments page.
* username and password: The credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
* vserverName: The name of the storage virtual machine (SVM) that contains data volumes. Get this value from Cloud Manager by opening the working environment and selecting *Information*.
* volumeName: The name of the volume name that you want to backup.
* fileSystemId: The file system UUID for the volume's backup copy. This value must be unique for every volume because it's used by the Cloud Backup Service to identify a volume. Generate an ID by running the "uuidgen" UNIX utility.
* sourceSnapshot (optional): Specify the name of a Snapshot copy that you want to backup. If you omit this parameter, the Cloud Backup Service backs up the volume based on its existing state.
* tag (optional): Specify a tag for the backup so you can search for it more easily.

=== Preparing scheduled backups

A scheduled backup triggers incremental backups at a defined interval. Prepare a separate JSON file for each volume that you want to backup.

.Steps

. Create a copy of _scheduled_backup.json_ and edit it by providing details about the volume.
+
[source,json]
{
      "ownerId": "e7855e3e-006d-49f0-bd1e-2c0df8fec505",
      "ontapIP": "10.193.78.9",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "netapp1!",
      "vserverName": "vs_seeni",
      "volumeName": "backup",
      "fileSystemId": "e2334e3e-226d-39f0-bd1e-1c0df6fec215",
      "snapmirrorPolicy": {
      "enabled": true,
      "daily-schedule": {
      "snapmirrorLabel": "sm_daily",
      "snapshotsToKeep": 24
      },
      "weekly-schedule": {
      "snapmirrorLabel": "sm_weekly",
      "snapshotsToKeep": 4
      },
      "monthly-schedule": {
      "snapmirrorLabel": "sm_monthly",
      "snapshotsToKeep": 40
     }
}
}
+
* ownerId: A unique identifier of the volume owner where the volume information can be retrieved. This is used for billing. Run the "uuidgen" UNIX utility to generate an ID.
* ontapIP: The cluster management IP of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system where the volume is located. Get this value from Cloud Manager by selecting the system from the Working Environments page.
* username and password: The credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
* vserverName: The name of the storage virtual machine (SVM) that contains data volumes. Get this value from Cloud Manager by opening the working environment and selecting *Information*.
* volumeName: The name of the volume name that you want to backup.
* fileSystemId: The file system UUID for the volume's backup copy. This value must be unique for every volume because it's used by Cloud Backup Service to identify a volume. Generate an ID by running the "uuidgen" UNIX utility.
* snapmirrorPolicy: Defines the SnapMirror policy for the scheduled backup.
* enabled: Enables the policy.
* daily-schedule: Defines daily scheduling information for the policy.
* weekly-schedule: Defines weekly scheduling information for the policy.
* monthly-schedule: Defines monthly scheduling information for the policy.
* snapmirrorLabel: A SnapMirror label for the rule.
* snapshotsToKeep: The number of Snapshot copies to keep.

. Create a Snapshot policy on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and modify the volume to use the Snapshot policy.
+
For scheduled backups to work, a corresponding Snapshot policy must be configured on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system and attached to the volume. The label for the Snapshot policy must match the value of the _snapmirrorLabel_ that you specified in the JSON file.
+
*Example*
+
`cluster1::> volume snapshot policy create -vserver vs0 -policy mysnappolicy -schedule1 hourly-count1 5 -prefix1 every_hour -snapmirror-label1 hrLabel`
+
`cluster1::> volume modify -vserver vs0 -volume backup -snapshot-policy mysnappolicy`

=== Preparing to restore volumes

Volume restores require a separate JSON file that you must specify when you run a restore operation.

.Steps

. Create a copy of _restore.json_ and edit it by providing details about the volume.
+
[source,json]
{
       "ownerId": "e7855e3e-006d-49f0-bd1e-2c0df8fec505",
       "ontapIP": "10.193.78.9",
       "username": "admin",
       "password": "netapp1!",
       "vserverName": "vs_seeni",
       "fileSystemId": "cf765c5f-84e6-4080-84a7-599ab8a31967",
       "destinationVolumeName": "retoreauth",
       "restoreSnapshot": ""
}
+
* ownerId: A unique identifier of the volume owner where the volume information can be retrieved.
* ontapIP: The cluster management IP of the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system where the volume is located. Get this value from Cloud Manager by selecting the system from the Working Environments page.
* username/password: The credentials for the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.
* vserverName: The name of the storage virtual machine (SVM) that contains data volumes. The value should match what you entered in the JSON file for the backup operation.
* fileSystemId: The file system UUID for the volume’s backup copy. The value should match what you entered in the JSON file for the backup operation.
* destinationVolumeName: Specify the name of the destination volume that you want to restore. The volume must be a data protection (DP) volume.
* restoreSnapshot: Specify the name of a Snapshot copy that you want to restore. Otherwise, the operation restores the latest Snapshot copy.

== Backing up and restoring volumes

Once you're ready, start backing up and restoring your volumes.

.Steps

. Run the following command from the Cloud Manager instance:
+
`./cvo-cbs-client`

. Select an action from the prompt:
+
1) Backup a volume:: Run a one-time backup. When prompted, specify the absolute path for the JSON file that corresponds to the volume that you want to backup.

2) Scheduled backup:: Use a scheduled backup to periodically trigger incremental backups. When prompted, specify the absolute path for the JSON file that corresponds to the volume that you want to backup.

3) Restore to a DP volume:: Restore a volume that you previously backed up. When prompted, specify the absolute path for the JSON file that corresponds to the volume that you want to restore.

4) Job Status:: Display the job status for backup and restore operations. Backup and restore operations are async operations, so you'll get a job ID when you run an operation. Use that ID as input when this option prompts for the jobId.

5) List Volume Backups:: List all backups corresponding to a volume. The fileSystemId that you specified in the backup JSON template must be provided as input to this option.

6) Exit:: Exit the prompt.

=== Mounting a restored volume

After you restore the volume, you'll need to mount it to view the files that it contains.

.Steps

. link:task_connecting_to_otc.html#connecting-to-the-cloud-volumes-ontap-cli[Connect to the Cloud Volumes ONTAP CLI].

. Add a junction path:
+
`volume mount -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -junction-path /<junction-path-name>`

. Verify that the volume is in the desired mount state:
+
`volume show -vserver <vserver_name> -volume <volume_name> -junction`

. Mount the volume to the client.

== Administering

* <<Updating the config.json file>>
* <<Troubleshooting unauthorized access>>
* <<Troubleshooting the fail to open database error>>

=== Updating the config.json file

If you need to update the _config.json_ file after you start the agent, you'll need to kill the service and then restart it.

.Steps

. Stop the Cloud Backup Service agent:
+
`ps -ef | grep -i cvo-cbs-service`
`kill -9 <service PID>`

. <<Configuring the Cloud Backup Service agent,Update the configuration file>>.

. <<Starting the Cloud Backup Service agent,Start the agent>>.

=== Troubleshooting unauthorized access

If there is a problem with the access token, you might receive the following error message:

 Post to CVO api server returned status code =401 and error Unauthorized

If this happens, generate a new token and update the _user_token.json_ file. For details, see <<Generating a user token for authentication>>.

=== Troubleshooting the fail to open database error

If you receive the following database error, kill the previously running cvo-cbs-service.

 Error setting up pending jobs db: timeout

. Stop the Cloud Backup Service agent:
+
`ps -ef | grep -i cvo-cbs-service`
`kill -9 <service PID>`

. <<Starting the Cloud Backup Service agent,Start the agent>>.
