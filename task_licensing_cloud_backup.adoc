summary: As mentioned in the Licensing overview, you can pay for Cloud Backup using a pay-as-you-go subscription through your cloud provider, an annual contract through AWS, or a bring-your-own license from NetApp. If you want to pay as you go or use an annual contract, then you need to subscribe from the marketplace for the cloud provider to which you want to back up data. There’s no need to subscribe from every marketplace.

As mentioned in the link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#licensing[Licensing overview], you can pay for Cloud Backup using a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription through your cloud provider, an annual contract through AWS, or a bring-your-own license (BYOL) from NetApp. If you want to pay as you go or use an annual contract, then you need to subscribe from the marketplace for the cloud provider to which you want to back up data. There’s no need to subscribe from every marketplace.

== Set up a PAYGO subscription

For pay-as-you-go you'll need to pay your cloud provider for object storage costs and NetApp for backup licensing costs. The licensing costs are based on target backup capacity (before ONTAP storage efficiencies). Use these links to subscribe to Cloud Backup from your cloud provider marketplace:

* AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07QX2QLXX[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

* Azure: https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/netapp.cloud-manager?tab=Overview[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^].

* GCP: https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project&rif_reserved[Go to the Cloud Manager Marketplace offering for pricing details^]

== Subscribe to yearly contracts through AWS

Annual contracts through the AWS Marketplace enable you to lock in a lower cost by subscribing to a 1-, 2-, or 3-year contract.

Go to the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B086PDWSS8[AWS Marketplace page^] to view pricing details of the two contract offerings, set up your subscription, and then link:task_adding_aws_accounts.html#associating-an-aws-subscription-to-credentials[associate the subscription with your AWS credentials].

== Use Cloud Backup BYOL licenses

Bring-your-own licenses also provide 1-, 2-, or 3-year term licenses from NetApp. You use the Digital Wallet page in Cloud Manager to manage BYOL licenses for the Cloud Backup service. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.
