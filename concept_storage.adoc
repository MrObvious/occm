Understanding how Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses cloud storage can help you understand your storage costs.

toc::[]

== Overview

Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses AWS and Azure volumes as back-end storage. It sees these volumes as disks and groups them into one or more aggregates. Aggregates provide storage to one or more volumes.

Several types of disks are supported. You choose the disk type when creating volumes and the default disk size when you deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

TIP: The total amount of storage purchased from AWS or Azure is the _raw capacity_. The _usable capacity_ is less because approximately 12 to 14 percent is overhead that is reserved for Cloud Volumes ONTAP use. For example, if Cloud Manager creates a 500 GB aggregate, the usable capacity is 442.94 GB.

== AWS storage

In AWS, an aggregate can contain up to 6 disks, with a maximum disk size of 16 TB. The underlying EBS disk type can be either General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, Throughput Optimized HDD, or Cold HDD. You can also pair an EBS disk with Amazon S3 for data tiering (not supported with Cold HDDs).

At a high level, the differences between EBS disk types are as follows:

* _General Purpose SSD_ disks balance cost and performance for a broad range of workloads. Performance is defined in terms of IOPS.

* _Provisioned IOPS SSD_ disks are for critical applications that require the highest performance at a higher cost.

* _Throughput Optimized HDD_ disks are for frequently accessed workloads that require fast and consistent throughput at a lower price.

* _Cold HDD_ disks are meant for backups, or infrequently accessed data, because the performance is very low. Like Throughput Optimized HDD disks, performance is defined in terms of throughput.

NOTE: Cold HDD disks are not supported with HA configurations.

For additional details about the use cases for these disks, refer to http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSVolumeTypes.html[AWS Documentation: EBS Volume Types^].

== Azure storage

In Azure, an aggregate can contain up to 12 disks, with a maximum disk size of 4 TB. The underlying Azure managed disk type can be either Standard Storage (HDD) or Premium Storage (SSD). You can also pair a managed disk with Azure Blob storage for data tiering.

The underlying managed disk type for Azure can be Premium Storage or Standard Storage:

* _Premium Storage_ disks store data on solid state drives (SSDs). The SSD disks provide high performance for I/O-intensive workloads at a higher cost.

* If you do not need high IOPS, you can reduce your costs by using _Standard Storage_ disks which are backed by hard disk drives (HDD).
