See Chapter 12 in the link:media/netapp_gfc_user_guide.pdf[NetApp Global File Cache User Guide^] for material you can use to train your users on the best practices that apply when working on a centralized data set/collaborative environment.  This includes suggested email content and a link to a training video.
