After you set up your working environment, you can create and manage Azure NetApp Files accounts, capacity pools, volumes, and snapshots.

== Creating volumes

You can create NFS or SMB volumes in a new or existing Azure NetApp Files account.

.Before you begin

* If you want to use SMB, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory.

* When planning to create an SMB volume, you must have a Windows Active Directory server available to which you can connect. You will enter this information when creating the volume.

.Steps

. Open the Azure NetApp Files working environment.

. Click *Add New Volume*.

. Provide the required information on each page:

* *Azure NetApp Files Account*: Choose an existing Azure NetApp Files account or create a new account. When creating a new account you can also choose the Resource Group that you want to use.

If you create a new capacity pool, you need to specify a size and select a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[service level^].
+
The minimum size for the capacity pool is 4 TB. You can specify a size in multiples of 4 TB.

* *Details & Tags*: Enter a volume name and size, the VNet and subnet where the volume should reside, and optionally specify tags for the volume.

* *Protocol*: Choose the NFS or SMB protocol and enter the required information.
