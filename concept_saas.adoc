We're introducing a software-as-a-service experience for Cloud Manager, starting in Google Cloud Platform. This new experience makes it easier for you to use Cloud Manager and enables us to provide additional ways for you to manage your hybrid cloud infrastructure.

== SaaS user interface

Cloud Manager is software that you deploy in your cloud network or on-premises network. It's comprised of a user interface and the management layer that sends requests to cloud providers.

Up until now, you would deploy Cloud Manager and then access the user interface running on that instance. That experience is changing.

You will now access a SaaS-based user interface from Cloud Central and then manage your hybrid-cloud environment from there.

In many cases, you need to deploy a _Service Connector_ in your cloud or on-premises network. The Service Connector is software that's needed to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other cloud data services. (The software is actually the same as Cloud Manager software--it includes the same user interface and management layer.)

== Benefits

This SaaS-based approach has several benefits:

* It enables us to offer more features for Cloud Volumes Service and Azure NetApp Files without needing to deploy any software in your environment

* It enables you to easily switch between your Cloud Central accounts
+
If a user is associated with multiple Cloud Central accounts, you can change to a different account at any time from the User Settings menu.

* It enables you to easily switch between Service Connectors that are installed in different networks or cloud providers (in other words, between multiple Cloud Manager instances in your environment)

== The local user interface

While you should perform almost all tasks from the SaaS user interface, a user interface is still available on the Service Connector. This interface is needed for a few tasks that need to be performed from the Service Connector itself:

* Setting a proxy server
* Installing a patch
* Downloading AutoSupport messages

You can access the local user interface directly from the SaaS user interface:

== Where is this new SaaS experience available?

This new SaaS experience is currently available in Google Cloud Platform for new users. We're planning to make it available for new users in AWS and Azure next, and then for existing users. Check the release notes for the latest updates.
