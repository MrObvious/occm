We're introducing a software-as-a-service experience for Cloud Manager, starting in Google Cloud Platform. This new experience makes it easier for you to use Cloud Manager and enables us to provide additional features to manage your hybrid cloud infrastructure.

== The current Cloud Manager experience

Cloud Manager software is comprised of a user interface and the management layer that sends requests to cloud providers. To get started, you deploy Cloud Manager in your cloud network or on-premises network and then access the user interface that runs on that instance.

That experience is changing.

== A new SaaS experience

The Cloud Manager interface will be accessible through a SaaS-based user interface that you log in to from NetApp Cloud Central. You'll no longer need to access a user interface from software that runs in your network.

In most cases, you will need to deploy a _Service Connector_ in your cloud or on-premises network. The Service Connector is software that's needed to manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP and other cloud data services. (The software is actually the same as the existing Cloud Manager software--it includes the same user interface and the same management layer.)

== Benefits

This SaaS-based approach provides several benefits:

* It enables us to offer additional management capabilities for Azure NetApp Files and Cloud Volumes Service without needing to deploy software in your environment.

* You can easily switch between your Cloud Central accounts.
+
If a user is associated with multiple Cloud Central accounts, they can change to a different account at any time from the User Settings menu. They can then see the Service Connectors and working environments that are associated with that account.

* You can easily switch between Service Connectors (what you know today as Cloud Manager instances) that are installed in different networks or different cloud providers.

== The local user interface

While you should perform almost all tasks from the SaaS user interface, a local user interface is still available on the Service Connector. This interface is needed for a few tasks that need to be performed from the Service Connector itself:

* Setting a proxy server
* Installing a patch
* Downloading AutoSupport messages

You can access the local user interface directly from the SaaS user interface:

== Where is this new SaaS experience available?

This new SaaS experience is currently available in Google Cloud Platform for new users. We're planning to make it available for new users in AWS and Azure next, and then for existing users. Check the release notes for the latest updates.
