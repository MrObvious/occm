== Scheduling automatic shutdowns of ONTAP Cloud instances

You might want to shut down ONTAP Cloud instances during specific time intervals to lower your compute costs. Rather than do this manually, you can configure Cloud Manager to automatically shut down and then restart instances at specific times.

.About this task

This task schedules automatic shutdowns of both nodes in an HA pair.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the clock icon:
+

. Specify the shutdown schedule:

.. Choose whether you want to shut down the instance every day, every weekday, every weekend, or any combination of the three options.

.. Specify when you want to turn off the instance and for how long you want it turned off.
+
*Example*
+
The following image shows a schedule that instructs Cloud Manager to shut down the instance every Saturday at 12:00 a.m. for 48 hours. Cloud Manager restarts the instance every Monday at 12:00 a.m.

. Click *Save*.

.Result

Cloud Manager saves the schedule. The clock icon changes to indicate that a schedule is set: image:screenshot_shutdown_icon_scheduled.gif[Screen shot: Shows the automatic shutdown icon after a schedule is defined.]

== Stopping ONTAP Cloud instances

Stopping ONTAP Cloud saves you from accruing compute costs and creates snapshots of the root and boot disks, which can be helpful for troubleshooting.

.About this task

When you stop an ONTAP Cloud HA pair, Cloud Manager shuts down both nodes.

.Steps

. From the working environment, click the *Turn off* icon.
+

. Keep the option to create snapshots enabled because the snapshots can enable system recovery.

. Click *Turn Off*.
+
It can take up to a few minutes to stop the instance or instances. You can restart instances at a later time from the working environment page.
