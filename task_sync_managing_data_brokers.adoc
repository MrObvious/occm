A data broker syncs data from a source location to a target location. A data broker is required for each sync relationship that you create. Manage data brokers by adding a new data broker to a group, by viewing information about data brokers, and more.

== Data broker groups

Grouping data brokers together can help improve the performance of sync relationships.

In many cases, a single data broker can meet the performance requirements for a sync relationship. If it doesnâ€™t, you can accelerate sync performance by adding additional data brokers to the group. But you should first check other factors that can impact sync performance. link:faq_sync.html#how-many-data-brokers-are-required[Learn more about how to determine when multiple data brokers are required].

A data broker group can consist of one or more AWS, Azure, _or_ GCP data brokers and one or more on-prem data brokers. A group can't consist of a mixture of AWS, Azure, and GCP data brokers. For example, a group can have two AWS data brokers and on on-prem data broker, but not one AWS data broker and one Azure data broker.

TIP: You can only add new data brokers to a group. You can't add existing data brokers to a group.

== Add a new data broker

There are several ways to create a new data broker:

* When creating a new sync relationship

== View a data broker's configuration

You might want to view details about a data broker to identify things like its host name, IP address, available CPU and RAM, and more.

Cloud Sync provides the following details about a data broker:

* Basic information: Instance ID, host name, etc.
* Network: Region, network, subnet, private IP, etc.
* Software: Linux distribution, data broker version, etc.
* Hardware: CPU and RAM
* Configuration: ??

.Steps

. Click *Sync > Manage Data Brokers*.

. Click image:screenshot_sync_group_expand.gif[A screenshot of the button that enables you to expand the list of data brokers in a group.] to expand the list of data brokers in a group.

. Click image:screenshot_sync_group_expand.gif[A screenshot of the button that enables you to expand details about a data broker.] to view details about a data broker.

== Remove a data broker from a group

You might remove a data broker from a group if it's no longer needed or if the initial deployment failed. This action only deletes the data broker from Cloud Sync's records. You'll need to manually delete the data broker and any additional cloud resources yourself.

.Steps

. Click *Sync > Manage Data Brokers*.

. Click image:screenshot_sync_group_expand.gif[A screenshot of the button that enables you to expand the list of data brokers in a group.] to expand the list of data brokers in a group.

. Click the action menu for a data broker and select *Remove Data Broker*.
+
image:screenshot_sync_group_remove.gif[A screenshot of the action menu that's available for each individual data broker group.]

Cloud Sync updates the name of the data broker group.

== Address issues with a data broker

Cloud Sync displays a status for each data broker that can help you troubleshoot issues.

.Steps

. Identify any data brokers that have a status of "Unknown" or "Failed."
+

. Hover over the image:screenshot_sync_status_icon.gif[] to see the failure reason.

For example, you might need to simply restart the data broker if it's offline, or you might need to remove data broker if the initial deployment failed.
