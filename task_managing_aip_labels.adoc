You can manage AIP labels in the files that Cloud Compliance is scanning if you have subscribed to link:https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/information-protection/[Azure Information Protection (AIP)^]. AIP enables you to classify and protect documents and files by applying labels to content. Cloud Compliance enables you to view the labels that are already assigned to files, add labels to files, and change labels when a label already exists.

Cloud Compliance support AIP labels within the following file types: .PDF, .DOCX, .DOC, .PPTX, .XLS, .XLSX.

== Integrating AIP labels in your workspace

Before you can manage AIP labels, you need to integrate the AIP label functionality into Cloud Compliance by signing into your existing Azure account. Once enabled, you can manage AIP labels within files for all link:concept_cloud_compliance.html#supported-working-environments-and-data-sources[working environments and data sources^] in your current Cloud Manager workspace.

.Requirements

* You must have an account and an Azure Information Protection license.
* You must have the login credentials for the Azure account.

.Steps

. From the Cloud Compliance Configuration page, click *Integrate AIP Labels*.

. In the Integrate AIP Labels dialog, click *Sign in to Azure*.

. In the Microsoft page that appears, select the account and enter the required credentials.

. Return to the Cloud Compliance tab and you'll see the message "_AIP Labels were integrated successfully with the account <account_name>_".

. Click *Close* and you'll see the text _AIP Labels integrated_ at the top of the page.

.Result

You can view and assign AIP labels from the results pane of the Investigation page. You can also assign AIP labels to files using highlights.

== Viewing AIP labels in your files

You can view the current AIP label that is assigned to a file.

In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_subfolder.png[right-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.

TIP: If a file has a label which doesn’t exist anymore in AIP, Cloud Compliance considers it as a file without a label.

== Managing AIP labels in your files

You can add, change, and remove AIP labels from your files using Cloud Compliance. This allows you to enhance the data protection of your files at all times with Azure Information Protection.

You can manage a label for a single file, or, using highlights, you can manage the label assigned to multiple files at the same time.

NOTE: If you plan to change labels in files that reside in Amazon S3 buckets, ensure that the permission `s3:PutObject` is included in the IAM role. See link:task_scanning_s3.html#reviewing-s3-prerequisites[setting up the IAM role^].

Note that you can't currently change labels in files larger than 30 MB. For OneDrive accounts the maximum file size is 4 MB.

=== Assigning AIP labels manually

Follow these steps to assign an AIP label to a single file.

. In the Data Investigation results pane, click image:button_subfolder.png[right-caret] for the file to expand the file metadata details.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_manually.png[A screenshot showing the metadata details for a file in the Data Investigation page.]

. Click *Assign a Label to this file* and then select the label.
+
The label appears in the file metadata.

// NOTE: You can't remove a label when modifying AIP labels manually.

=== Assigning AIP labels automatically with highlights

You can assign an AIP label to all the files that meet the criteria of the highlight. You can specify the AIP label when creating the highlight, or you can add the label when editing any highlight.

Labels are added or updated in files continuously as Cloud Compliance scans your files.

Depending on whether a label is already applied to a file, and the classification level of the label, the following actions are taken when changing a label:

[cols=2*,options="header",cols="65,35"]
|===

| If the file...
| Then...

| Has no label | The label is added
| Has an existing label of a lower level of classification | The higher level label is added
| Has an existing label of a higher level of classification |	The higher level label is retained
| Is assigned a label both manually and by a highlight | The higher level label is added
| Is assigned two different labels by two highlights |	The higher level label is added

|===

Follow these steps to add an AIP label to an existing highlight.

. From the Highlights List page, click *Edit* for the highlight where you want to add (or change) the AIP label.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_1.png[A screenshot showing how to edit an existing highlight.]

. In the Edit Highlight page, check the box to enable automatic labels for files that match the highlight parameters, and select the label (for example, *General*).
+
image:screenshot_compliance_add_label_highlight_2.png[A screenshot showing how to select the label to be assigned to files that match the highlight.]

. Click *Save Highlight* and the label appears in the highlight description.

NOTE: If a highlight was configured with a label, but the label has since been removed from AIP, the label name is turned to OFF and the label is not assigned anymore.

// You can remove a label by clicking the “None” option.

== Removing the AIP integration

If you no longer want the ability to manage AIP labels in files, you can remove the AIP account from the Cloud Compliance interface.

Note that no changes are made to the labels you have added using Cloud Compliance. The labels that exist in files will stay as they currently exist.

.Steps

. From the _Scan Configuration_ page, click *AIP Labels integrated > Remove Integration*.
+

. Click *Remove Integration* from the confirmation dialog.
