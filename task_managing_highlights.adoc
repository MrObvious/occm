Highlights are like a favorites list of custom filters that provide search results in the Investigation page for commonly requested compliance queries. Cloud Compliance provides a set of predefined Highlights based on common customer questions. You can also create custom Highlights that provide results for searches specific to your organization.

The *Highlights* tab in the Compliance Dashboard lists all the Highlights available on this instance of Cloud Compliance.

In addition, Highlights appear in the list of Filters in the Investigation page.

* Ability to create your own custom highlights
* Launch the Investigation page with the results from your highlights in one click
* Send email alerts to Cloud Manager users (daily, weekly, or monthly) when certain critical highlights return results so you can get notifications to protect your data
* Assign AIP (Azure Information Protection) labels automatically to all files that are returned in a highlight. See link:task_managing_aip_labels.html#assigning-aip-labels-automatically-with-highlightsd[Assigning AIP labels automatically with highlights] for details

.Result

The new highlight appears in the Highlights tab. Additionally, if you enabled email notifications, the first email is sent now if there are any results from the highlight - if any files meet the highlight criteria.

== Editing highlights

You can modify certain parts of a highlight depending on the type of highlight:

* Custom highlights - You can modify the _Name_, the _Description_, and whether email notifications are sent.
* Predefined highlights - You can modify only whether email notifications are sent.

NOTE: If you need to change the filter parameters for a custom highlight, you'll need to create a new highlight with the parameters you want, and then delete the old highlight.

To modify a highlight, click the *Edit* button, enter your changes on the _Edit Highlight_ page, and click *Save Highlight*.

==	Deleting highlights

You can delete any custom highlight that you created if you no longer need it. You can't delete any of the predefined highlights.

To delete a highlight, click the image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More button] button for a specific highlight, click *Delete Highlight*, and then click *Delete Highlight* again in the confirmation dialog.
