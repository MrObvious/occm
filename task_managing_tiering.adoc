Now that you've set up data tiering from your ONTAP clusters, you can tier data from additional volumes, change a volume's tiering policy, and more.

== Tiering data from additional volumes

Set up data tiering for additional volumes at any time--for example, after creating a new volume.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Tiering*.

. From the *Cluster Dashboard*, click *Tier Volumes* for the cluster.

. On the *Tier Volumes* page, set up tiering for each volume.
+
link:concept_cloud_tiering.html#volume-tiering-policies[Learn more about volume tiering policies].
+
TIP: You don't need to configure the object storage because it was already configured when you initially set up tiering for the cluster. ONTAP will tier inactive data from these volumes to the same object store.
+
* To select a tiering policy for just one volume, click the image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[A screenshot of the edit icon that appears at the end of each row in the table for tiering volumes] icon, select a tiering policy, and optionally adjust the cooling days.
+

* To select a tiering policy for several volumes, select multiple volumes, click *Modify selected volumes*, select a tiering policy, and optionally adjust the cooling days.
+

== Changing a volume's tiering policy

Changing the tiering policy for a volume changes how ONTAP tiers cold data to object storage. The change starts from the moment that you change the policy--it changes only the subsequent tiering behavior for the volume.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Tiering*.

. From the *Cluster Dashboard*, click *Tier Volumes* for the cluster.

. Click the image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[A screenshot of the edit icon that appears at the end of each row in the table for tiering volumes] icon, select a tiering policy, optionally adjust the cooling days, and click *Apply*.

== Managing tiering settings on aggregates

Each aggregate has two settings that you can adjust: the tiering fullness threshold and whether inactive data reporting is enabled.

Tiering fullness threshold::
Setting the threshold to a lower number reduces the amount of data required to be stored on the performance tier before tiering takes place. This might be useful for large aggregates that contain little active data.
+
Setting the threshold to a higher number increases the amount of data required to be stored on the performance tier before tiering takes place. This might be useful for solutions designed to tier only when aggregates are near maximum capacity.

Inactive data reporting::
Inactive data reporting (IDR) uses a 31-day cooling period to determine which data is considered inactive. The amount of cold data that is tiered is dependent on the tiering policies set on volumes. This amount might be different than the amount of cold data detected by IDR using a 31-day cooling period.
+
TIP: It's best to keep IDR enabled because it helps to identify your inactive data and savings opportunities. IDR must remain enabled if data tiering was enabled on an aggregate.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Tiering*.

. From the *Cloud Tiering* page, click the menu icon for a cluster and select *Manage Aggregates*.
+

. On the *Manage Aggregates* page, click the image:screenshot_edit_icon.gif[A screenshot of the edit icon that appears at the end of each row in the table for managing aggregates] icon for an aggregate in the table.

. Modify the fullness threshold and choose whether to enable or disable inactive data reporting.
+

. Click *Apply*.

== Reviewing tiering info for a cluster

You might want to see how much data is in the cloud tier and how much data is on disks. Or, you might want to see the amount of hot and cold data on the cluster's disks. Cloud Tiering provides this information for each cluster.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Tiering*.

. From the *Cluster Dashboard*, click the menu icon for a cluster and select *Cluster info*.

. Review details about the cluster.
+
Here's an example:

== Fixing operational health

Failures can happen. When they do, Cloud Tiering displays a "Failed" operational health status on the Cluster Dashboard. The health reflects the status of the ONTAP system and Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. Identify any clusters that have an operational health of "Failed."

. Hover over the image:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-tiering/media/screenshot_info_icon.gif[A screenshot of the i icon that shows the failure reason] icon to see the failure reason.

. Correct the issue:

.. Verify that the ONTAP cluster is operational and that it has an inbound and outbound connection to your object storage provider.

.. Verify that Cloud Manager has outbound connections to the Cloud Tiering service, to the object store, and to the ONTAP clusters that it discovers.

== Discovering additional clusters from Cloud Tiering

You can add your undiscovered on-prem ONTAP clusters to Cloud Manager from the Tiering _Cluster Dashboard_ so that you can enable tiering for the cluster.

If your NSS credentials are saved in Cloud Manager, the top of the page displays whether you have any on-prem clusters in your account that have not been discovered in Cloud Manager.

If your NSS credentials are not already saved in Cloud Manager, you are first prompted to add your credentials before you can see if there are undiscovered clusters.  See link:task_adding_nss_accounts.html[Adding NetApp Support Site accounts to Cloud Manager^] for more information.

Note that buttons appear in the Tiering _On-Prem Overview_ page as well for you to discover additional clusters. 

.Steps

. From Cloud Tiering, click the *Cluster Dashboard* tab.

. If the overview row at the top of the page shows that you have undiscovered on-prem clusters, scroll down the page to locate the clusters.
+
image:screenshot_tiering_discover_cluster.png[A screenshot showing how to discover an existing cluster to add to Cloud Manager and the Tiering Dashboard.]

. Click *Discover Cluster* for the cluster that you want to manage through Cloud Manager and implement data tiering.

. On the _ONTAP Cluster Details_ page, enter the password for the admin user account and click *Add*.
+
Note that the cluster management IP address is populated based on information from your NSS account.

.Result

Cloud Manager discovers the cluster and adds it to a working environment in the Canvas using the cluster name as the working environment name.

You can enable the Tiering service or other services for this cluster in the right panel.
