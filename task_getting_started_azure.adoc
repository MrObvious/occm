Get started with Cloud Volumes ONTAP in a few steps.

These steps assume that you're creating your first working environment, that you haven't created a link:concept_connectors.html[Connector] yet, and that you'll create the Connector in Azure directly from Cloud Manager (see the links at the end of the page for alternatives).

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Plan your configuration

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Cloud Manager offers preconfigured packages that match your workload requirements, or you can create your own configuration. If you choose your own configuration, you should understand the options available to you. link:task_planning_your_config_azure.html[Learn more].

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Provide the required Azure permissions

[role="quick-margin-para"]
When you create your first working environment, Cloud Manager prompts you to create a Connector, which enables Cloud Manager to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment. You need the right permissions to create the Connector in Azure.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You'll need to download the https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Azure policy for the Connector^], modify the "AssignableScopes" field by adding your subscription, use the file in Azure to create a custom role and assign the role to the user.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Set up your networking

[role="quick-margin-list"]
.. Ensure that your VNet and subnets will support connectivity between the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. Enable outbound internet access from the target VNet so the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP can contact several endpoints.

This step is important because the Connector can't manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP without outbound internet access. If you need to limit outbound connectivity, refer to the list of endpoints for link:reference_networking_azure.html[the Connector and Cloud Volumes ONTAP].

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Launch Cloud Volumes ONTAP using Cloud Manager

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Add Working Environment*, select the type of system that you would like to deploy, and complete the steps in the wizard. link:task_deploying_otc_azure.html[Read step-by-step instructions].
