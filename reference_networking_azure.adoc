= Networking requirements for Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure

[.lead]
Set up your Azure networking so Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems can operate properly.

== Networking requirements

The following requirements must be met in Azure.

Outbound internet access for Cloud Volumes ONTAP::
Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires outbound internet access to send messages to NetApp AutoSupport, which proactively monitors the health of your storage.
+
Routing and firewall policies must allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the following endpoints so Cloud Volumes ONTAP can send AutoSupport messages:
+
* \https://support.netapp.com/aods/asupmessage
* \https://support.netapp.com/asupprod/post/1.0/postAsup
+
link:task_setting_up_ontap_cloud.html[Learn how to configure AutoSupport].

Security groups::
You do not need to create security groups because Cloud Manager does that for you. If you need to use your own, refer to link:reference_security_groups_azure.html[Security group rules].

Number of IP addresses::
Cloud Manager allocates the following number of IP addresses to Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure:

* Single node: 5 IP addresses
* HA pair: 16 IP addresses
+
Note that Cloud Manager creates an SVM management LIF on HA pairs, but not on single node systems in Azure.
+
TIP: A LIF is an IP address associated with a physical port. An SVM management LIF is required for management tools like SnapCenter.

Connection from Cloud Volumes ONTAP to Azure Blob storage for data tiering::
If you want to tier cold data to Azure Blob storage, you don't need to set up a connection between the performance tier and the capacity tier as long as Cloud Manager has the required permissions. Cloud Manager enables a VNet service endpoint for you if the Cloud Manager policy has these permissions:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets/write",
"Microsoft.Network/routeTables/join/action",
+
These permissions are included in the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/cloudontap/iampolicies[Cloud Manager policy].
+
For details about setting up data tiering, see link:task_tiering.html[Tiering cold data to low-cost object storage].

Connections to ONTAP systems in other networks::
To replicate data between a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system in Azure and ONTAP systems in other networks, you must have a VPN connection between the Azure VNet and the other networkâ€”for example, an AWS VPC or your corporate network.
+
For instructions, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal[Microsoft Azure Documentation: Create a Site-to-Site connection in the Azure portal^].

== Security group rules for Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Cloud Manager creates Azure security groups that include the inbound and outbound rules that Cloud Volumes ONTAP needs to operate successfully. You might want to refer to the ports for testing purposes or if you prefer your to use own security groups.

The security group for Cloud Volumes ONTAP requires both inbound and outbound rules.

=== Inbound rules for single node systems

The rules listed below allow traffic, unless the description notes that it blocks specific inbound traffic.

=== Inbound rules for HA systems

The rules listed below allow traffic, unless the description notes that it blocks specific inbound traffic.

NOTE: HA systems have less inbound rules than single node systems because inbound data traffic goes through the Azure Standard Load Balancer. Because of this, traffic from the Load Balancer should be open, as shown in the "AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound" rule.
