You can start creating Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems right after you deploy Cloud Manager. However, you might want to perform additional setup first by setting up the AWS Key Management Service, installing an HTTPS certificate, and more.

== Setting up the AWS KMS

If you want to use Amazon encryption with Cloud Volumes ONTAP, then you must set up the AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

.Steps

. Ensure that an active CMK exists in your account.
+
The CMK can be an AWS-managed CMK or a customer-managed CMK.

. Add the IAM role associated with the Cloud Manager instance to the list of key users for a CMK.
+
This gives Cloud Manager permissions to use the CMK with Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

== Installing an HTTPS certificate for secure access

By default, Cloud Manager uses a self-signed certificate for HTTPS access to the web console. You can install a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA), which provides better security protection than a self-signed certificate.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the task drop-down list, and then select *HTTPS Setup*.

. In the HTTPS Setup page, install a certificate by generating a certificate signing request (CSR) or by installing your own CA-signed certificate:

|===
| Option
| Description
| Generate a CSR
a|
.. Enter the host name or DNS of the Cloud Manager host (its Common Name), and then click *Generate CSR*.
+
Cloud Manager displays a certificate signing request.

.. Use the CSR to submit an SSL certificate request to a CA.
+
The certificate must use the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Base-64 encoded X.509 format.

.. Copy the contents of the signed certificate, paste it in the Certificate field, and then click *Install*.

| Install your own CA-signed certificate
a|
.. Select *Install CA-signed certificate*.

.. Load both the certificate file and the private key and then click *Install*.
+
The certificate must use the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) Base-64 encoded X.509 format.
|===

.Result

Cloud Manager now uses the CA-signed certificate to provide secure HTTPS access. The following image shows a Cloud Manager system that is configured for secure access:

== Adding users to Cloud Manager

If additional users need to use your Cloud Manager system, they must sign up for an account in NetApp Cloud Central. You can then add the users to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. If the user does not yet have an account in NetApp Cloud Central, send them a link to your Cloud Manager system and have them sign up.
+
Wait until the user confirms that they have signed up for an account.

. In Cloud Manager, click the user icon and then click *View Users*.

. Click *New User*.

. Enter the email address associated with the user account, select a role, and click *Add*.

.After you finish

Inform the user that they can now log in to the Cloud Manager system.

== Linking tenants to a NetApp Support Site account

You should link a tenant to a NetApp Support Site account so Cloud Manager can manage licenses for BYOL systems, register pay-as-you-go instances for support, and upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP software. For more information about these benefits, https://youtu.be/_8s16fS_L1Y[watch this video^].

.Before you begin

Each NetApp Support Site account that you link to a tenant must meet the following requirements:

* The account must be a NetApp customer-level account (not a guest or temp account).
* If you purchased a secure BYOL subscription, then a _secure_ NetApp Support Site account is required to upload the license file.
+
Contact your NetApp account team for further information about secure BYOL subscriptions.
* The account must be authorized to access the serial numbers of any BYOL systems deployed in the tenant.

If you do not have an account, you can create one from the http://mysupport.netapp.com/[NetApp Support Site^].

.Steps

. Click the tenants icon and then click *Switch Tenant*.
+

. Click the edit icon for the tenant that you want to link to a NetApp Support Site account.
+

. Click *Change NSS account*.

. Enter the user name and password for the account and click *Save*.

.Result

Cloud Manager registers all existing and future Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in the tenant with NetApp support.
