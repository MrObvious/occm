Complete a few steps to start scanning data within object storage directly with Cloud Compliance. Compliance can scan data from any Object Storage service which uses the Simple Storage Service (S3) protocol. This includes NetApp StorageGRID, IBM Cloud Object Store, Azure Blob (using MinIO), Linode, B2 Cloud Storage, and more.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Review object storage prerequisites

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need to have the endpoint URL to connect with the object storage service.

[role="quick-margin-para"]
You need to have the Access Key and Secret Key from the object storage provider so that Cloud Compliance can access the buckets.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Deploy the Cloud Compliance instance

[role="quick-margin-para"]
link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[Deploy Cloud Compliance^] if there isn't already an instance deployed.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Add the Object Storage Service

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Add the object storage service to Cloud Compliance.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4] Select the buckets to scan

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select the buckets that you'd like to scan and Cloud Compliance will start scanning them.

== Reviewing object storage requirements

Review the following prerequisites to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you enable Cloud Compliance.

* You need to have the endpoint URL to connect with the object storage service.

* You need to have the Access Key and Secret Key from the object storage provider so that Cloud Compliance can access the buckets.

* Support for Azure Blob requires that you use the link:https://min.io/[MinIO service^].

== Adding the object storage service to Cloud Compliance

You must have link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed an instance of Cloud Compliance in Cloud Manager already^].

Add the object storage service.

.Steps

. From the Working Environments Configuration page, click *Add Data Source* > *Add Object Storage Service*.

. In the Add Object Storage Service dialog, enter the details for the object storage service and click *Continue*.
.. Enter the name you want to use for the Working Environment. This name should reflect the name of the object storage service to which you are connecting.
.. Enter the Endpoint URL to access the object storage service.
.. Enter the Access Key and Secret Key so that Cloud Compliance can access the buckets in the object storage.

.Result

The new Object Storage Service is added to the list of working environments.

== Enabling and disabling compliance scans on object storage buckets

After you enable Cloud Compliance on your Object Storage Service, the next step is to configure the buckets that you want to scan. Cloud Compliance discovers those buckets and displays them in the working environment you created.

.Steps

. In the Configuration page, click *Configuration* from the Object Storage Service working environment.
+

. Enable compliance on the buckets that you want to scan.

.Result

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the buckets that you enabled. If there are any errors, they'll appear in the Status column, alongside the required action to fix the error.
