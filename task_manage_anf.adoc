View and create NFS volumes for https://cloud.netapp.com/azure-netapp-files[Azure NetApp Files^] directly from Cloud Manager.

== Setting up your configuration

Your configuration needs to meet a few requirements before you can manage volumes for Azure NetApp Files from Cloud Manager.

. Azure NetApp Files must be set up by completing the following from the Azure portal:

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register[Register for Azure NetApp Files^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-netapp-account[Create a NetApp account^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool[Set up a capacity pool^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet[Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files^]

. Cloud Manager must be set up as follows:

* Cloud Manager must be running in Azure, in the account where Azure NetApp Files was set up.

* The Cloud Manager virtual machine must receive permissions through a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[managed identity^].
+
If you deployed Cloud Manager from Cloud Central, then you're all set. Cloud Central automatically enables a system-assigned managed identity on the Cloud Manager virtual machine.
+
If you deployed Cloud Manager from the Azure Marketplace, then you should have followed link:task_launching_azure_mktp.html[instructions to enable a managed identity].

* The Azure role assigned to the Cloud Manager virtual machine must include the permissions listed in the latest https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.7.4.json[Cloud Manager policy for Azure^]:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/write",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/delete"

When your configuration is set up, Cloud Manager automatically displays Azure NetApp Files on the Working Environments page:

== Syncing data to Azure NetApp Files

You can migrate NFS or SMB data to Azure NetApp Files directly from Cloud Manager. Just select the working environment and click *Sync*. Data syncs are powered by NetApp's Cloud Sync service.

=== Overview

Cloud Sync is NetApp's service for rapid and secure data synchronization. Cloud Sync is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that consists of a data broker, a cloud-based portal, and a source and target.

image:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudsync/media/diagram_cloud_sync_overview.gif[Conceptual image that shows data flowing from a source to a target. The data broker software acts as a mediator and polls the Cloud Sync service for tasks.]

At this time, Cloud Sync's integration with Cloud Manager enables you to sync data from a source NFS or SMB server to Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files is supported as a target only.

When you create a sync relationship for Azure NetApp Files, you need to deploy a data broker in Azure. The NetApp data broker software syncs data from a source to a target (this is called a _sync relationship_). You can use a single data broker for multiple sync relationships.

After the initial copy, the service syncs any changed data based on the schedule that you set.

=== Cost

NetApp doesn't charge you to sync data to Azure NetApp Files.

=== Requirements

Prepare to sync data by verifying that your source and target are supported and setup.

==== Networking requirements

Networking for Cloud Sync includes connectivity between the data broker and the source and target locations, and an outbound internet connection from the data broker over port 443.

* The source and target must have a network connection to the data broker, which you'll deploy in an Azure VNet.
+
For example, if an NFS server is in your data center and the data broker is in Azure, then you need a network connection (VPN or ExpressRoute) from your network to the Azure VNet and from the Azure VNet to the Azure NetApp Files location.

* The data broker needs an outbound internet connection so it can poll the Cloud Sync service for tasks over port 443.
+
When Cloud Sync deploys the data broker in Azure, it creates a security group that enables the required outbound communication.
+
If you need to limit outbound connectivity, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudsync/reference_endpoints.html[see the list of endpoints that the data broker contacts^].

* NetApp recommends configuring the source, target, and data broker to use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service. The time difference between the three components should not exceed 5 minutes.

==== NFS and SMB server requirements

* The server can be a NetApp system or a non-NetApp system.
* The file server must allow the data broker host to access the exports.
* NFS versions 3, 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 are supported.
* SMB versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0 are supported.
+
The desired version must be enabled on the server.

=== Creating a sync relationship

When you create a sync relationship, the Cloud Sync service copies files from the source to the target. After the initial copy, the service syncs any changed data every 24 hours.

.Steps

. Select the Azure NetApp Files working environment.

. Click *Sync Data*.
+

!!! Add a screenshot here.

. Click *Log in to Azure*.
+
When prompted, sign in and accept the permissions request from Microsoft. The form is owned and hosted by Microsoft. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

. Select an Azure subscription.
+
This is the subscription that includes the volume to which you want to sync the data.

. Select a volume and click *Continue*.
+
While you can select an SMB or NFS volume, the remaining steps describe what happens if you select an SMB volume.

. Enter Active Directory credentials for the SMB volume and click *Continue*.

. Follow the steps in the Sync Data Wizard.
+
.. *Data Broker*: Select an existing data broker or provide information to deploy a new data broker and click *Continue*.
+
image:screenshot_data_broker_azure.gif[]
+
!!! Add a screenshot here.
+
Keep the page open until the deployment is complete. It can take up to 5 minutes to deploy a new data broker.

.. *Target Shares*: Select the share to which you want to sync the data and then click *Continue*.

.. *SMB Server*: Now you need to provide details about the source server that contains the data. Select an SMB version, enter the IP address of the source server, specify the SMB credentials, and then choose whether to copy Access Control Lists (ACLs) to the target.

.. *Shares*: Select the source share that you want to sync.

.. *Review*: Review details about the sync relationship and then click *Sync*.
+

+
!!! Add a screenshot here.

.. Click *View in Dashboard* to view details about the sync relationship.

=== Managing sync relationships

A few actions are available from within Cloud Manager to manage your sync relationships. You can go to the Cloud Sync service to access additional actions, such as managing sync settings or accelerating performance.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Sync*.

. Hover over the sync relationship and click the action menu.

. Select one of the available options.

The Cloud Sync service opens in another browser tab. If you can't see your sync relationships, then make sure that you're viewing the right Cloud Central account. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudsync/concept_accounts.html[Learn more about accounts^].

== Getting help

Use the Cloud Manager chat for general service questions.

For technical support issues associated with Azure NetApp Files, use the Azure portal to log a support request to Microsoft. Select your associated Microsoft subscription and select the *Azure NetApp Files* service name under *Storage.* Provide the remaining information required to create your Microsoft support request.

Cloud Manager provides a local AutoSupport download under the *Support Dashboard* menu option. This 7z file contains an Azure debug file to show inbound and outbound communication to your Azure NetApp Files account.

== Limitations

* Cloud Manager doesn't support SMB volumes.

* Cloud Manager doesn't enable you to manage capacity pools or volume snapshots.

* You can create volumes with an initial size and single export policy. Editing a volume must be done from the Azure NetApp Files interface in the Azure portal.

* Cloud Manager doesn't support data replication to or from Azure NetApp Files.
