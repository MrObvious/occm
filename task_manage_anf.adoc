Cloud Manager enables you to manage volumes for https://cloud.netapp.com/azure-netapp-files[Azure NetApp Files^] directly from its interface. You can view volumes, create NFS volumes, migrate data to Azure NetApp Files from an NFS or SMB server, and scan Azure NetApp Files using Cloud Compliance.

== Setting up your configuration

Your configuration needs to meet a few requirements before you can manage volumes for Azure NetApp Files from Cloud Manager.

. Azure NetApp Files must be set up by completing the following from the Azure portal:

* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register[Register for Azure NetApp Files^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-create-netapp-account[Create a NetApp account^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-set-up-capacity-pool[Set up a capacity pool^]
* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-delegate-subnet[Delegate a subnet to Azure NetApp Files^]

. Cloud Manager must be set up as follows:

* Cloud Manager must be running in Azure, in the account where Azure NetApp Files was set up.

* The Cloud Manager virtual machine must receive permissions through a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview[managed identity^].
+
If you deployed Cloud Manager from Cloud Central, then you're all set. Cloud Central automatically enables a system-assigned managed identity on the Cloud Manager virtual machine.
+
If you deployed Cloud Manager from the Azure Marketplace, then you should have followed link:task_launching_azure_mktp.html[instructions to enable a managed identity].

* The Azure role assigned to the Cloud Manager virtual machine must include the permissions listed in the latest https://occm-sample-policies.s3.amazonaws.com/Policy_for_cloud_Manager_Azure_3.8.5.json[Cloud Manager policy for Azure^]:
+
[source,json]
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/write",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/read",
"Microsoft.NetApp/netAppAccounts/capacityPools/volumes/delete"
"Microsoft.Insights/Metrics/Read"

When your configuration is set up, Cloud Manager automatically displays Azure NetApp Files on the Working Environments page:

== Migrating data to Azure NetApp Files

You can migrate NFS or SMB data to Azure NetApp Files directly from Cloud Manager. Just select the working environment and click *Sync*. Data migrations are powered by NetApp's Cloud Sync service.

=== Overview

Cloud Sync is NetApp's service for rapid and secure data synchronization. Cloud Sync is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform that consists of a data broker, a cloud-based portal, and a source and target.

image:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudsync/media/diagram_cloud_sync_overview.gif[Conceptual image that shows data flowing from a source to a target. The data broker software acts as a mediator and polls the Cloud Sync service for tasks.]

At this time, Cloud Sync's integration with Cloud Manager enables you to migrate data from a source NFS or SMB server to Azure NetApp Files through a one-time copy. Azure NetApp Files is supported as a target only. The target must be a volume that uses the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[Ultra service level^]. No other service levels are supported.

When you set up a data sync to Azure NetApp Files, you need to deploy a data broker in Azure. The NetApp data broker software syncs data from a source to a target (this is called a _sync relationship_). You can use a single data broker for multiple sync relationships.

=== Cost

NetApp doesn't charge you to sync data to Azure NetApp Files.

=== Requirements

Prepare to sync data by verifying that your source and target are supported and setup.

==== Networking requirements

Networking for Cloud Sync includes connectivity between the data broker and the source and target locations, and an outbound internet connection from the data broker over port 443.

* The source and target must have a network connection to the data broker, which you'll deploy in an Azure VNet.
+
For example, if an NFS server is in your data center and the data broker is in Azure, then you need a network connection (VPN or ExpressRoute) from your network to the Azure VNet and from the Azure VNet to the Azure NetApp Files location.

* The data broker needs an outbound internet connection so it can poll the Cloud Sync service for tasks over port 443.
+
When Cloud Sync deploys the data broker in Azure, it creates a security group that enables the required outbound communication.
+
If you need to limit outbound connectivity, https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudsync/reference_endpoints.html[see the list of endpoints that the data broker contacts^].

* NetApp recommends configuring the source, target, and data broker to use a Network Time Protocol (NTP) service. The time difference between the three components should not exceed 5 minutes.

==== NFS and SMB server requirements

* The server can be a NetApp system or a non-NetApp system.
* The file server must allow the data broker host to access the exports.
* NFS versions 3, 4.0, 4.1, and 4.2 are supported.
* SMB versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0 are supported.
+
The desired version must be enabled on the server.

=== Migrating data

When you create a sync relationship, the Cloud Sync service copies files from the source to the target volume. The schedule for the sync relationship is a one-time copy--there are no additional syncs in the schedule. You can sync the data again by <<Managing sync relationships,managing the relationship>>.

The target volume in Azure NetApp Files must be a volume that uses the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[Ultra service level^]. No other service levels are supported.

.Steps

. Select the Azure NetApp Files working environment.

. Click *Sync Data*.
+
image:screenshot_sync_anf.gif[A screenshot that shows the Sync Data option that appears on the right side of the screen after you select an Azure NetApp Files working environment.]

. Click *Log in to Azure*.
+
When prompted, sign in and accept the permissions request from Microsoft. The form is owned and hosted by Microsoft. Your credentials are not provided to NetApp.

. Select an Azure subscription.
+
This is the subscription that includes the volume to which you want to sync the data.

. Select a volume and click *Continue*.
+
This is the volume to which the data will be tiered.
+
The target volume must be a volume that uses the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-service-levels[Ultra service level^]. No other service levels are supported.

. If you selected an SMB volume, enter Active Directory credentials for the volume and click *Continue*.

. Follow the steps in the Sync Data Wizard.
+
.. *Data Broker*: Select an existing data broker or provide information to deploy a new data broker and click *Continue*.
+
image:screenshot_data_broker_azure.gif[A screenshot that shows the Data Broker page filled out with details needed to deploy the data broker in Azure.]
+
Keep the page open until the deployment is complete. It can take up to 5 minutes to deploy a new data broker.

.. *Target Shares/Directories*: Select the share or directory to which you want to sync the data and then click *Continue*.

.. *SMB/NFS Server*: Now you need to provide details about the source server that contains the data that you want to migrate. Select an existing SMB or NFS server that you previously entered, or enter information about a new source server and click *Continue*.

.. *Shares/Directories*: Select the source share or directory that you want to sync to Azure NetApp Files.

.. *Review*: Review details about the sync relationship and then click *Sync*.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_sync_review.gif[A screenshot that shows the review screen, which shows you data going from your source server and directory to your target.]

.. Click *View in Dashboard* to view details about the sync relationship.

=== Managing sync relationships

A few actions are available from within Cloud Manager to manage your existing sync relationships. You can immediately sync the data again and you can delete relationships.

If needed, you can click a link to go directly to the Cloud Sync service where you can access additional actions, such as managing sync settings or accelerating performance.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Sync*.

. Hover over the sync relationship and click the action menu.

. Select one of the available options.
+
image:screenshot_cloud_sync_menu.gif[]

. If you want to access additional options, click *View in Cloud Sync*.
+
image:screenshot_view_cloud_sync.gif[A screenshot that shows the View in Cloud Sync link that's available in the top right of the Sync page.]
+
The Cloud Sync service opens in another browser tab. If you can't see your sync relationships, then make sure that you're viewing the right Cloud Central account. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudsync/concept_accounts.html[Learn more about accounts^].

== Scanning volumes for data privacy compliance

Using Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven technology, Cloud Compliance can help you understand data context and identify sensitive data that resides in your Azure NetApp Files accounts. link:concept_cloud_compliance.html[Learn more].

== Getting help

For technical support issues associated with Azure NetApp Files, use the Azure portal to log a support request to Microsoft. Select your associated Microsoft subscription and select the *Azure NetApp Files* service name under *Storage*. Provide the remaining information required to create your Microsoft support request.

For issues related to Cloud Sync and Azure NetApp Files, you can start with NetApp using your Cloud Sync serial number directly from the Cloud Sync service.
