summary: The Application Templates service enables you to standardize resource creation in your working environments. For example, you can hard-code required parameters in a "volume template" that are later applied when a storage admin creates a volume. This can include required disk type, size, protocol, snapshot policy, cloud provider, and more. You can also turn on certain services, like Cloud Backup, for every created volume.

The Application Templates service enables you to standardize resource creation in your working environments. For example, you can hard-code required parameters in a "volume template" that are later applied when a storage admin creates a volume. This can include required disk type, size, protocol, snapshot policy, cloud provider, and more. You can also turn on certain services, like Cloud Backup, for every created volume.

Templates make it easy for your storage admins to create volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for each deployed application; such as databases, email, or streaming services. And it makes life easier for your storage architects knowing that each volume is created correctly for each application.

== Features

Application Templates offers the following features and benefits:

* Automates and improves the design and development of your infrastructure
* Provides a single location to activate different NetApp Cloud services
* Enforces template settings with the "drift" feature so that users don't make changes that are no longer aligned with the template definition
* f

=== What is "drift"?

Select "Drift On" so we can monitor the parameter values used when a resource is created with the template. Then we can notify you if the parameter value is later modified and is no longer aligned with the template definition.

== Supported object storage providers

Templates can be built for Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes created in any cloud provider, and for Azure NetApp Files volumes.

You can tier inactive data from an ONTAP cluster to Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure Blob storage, Google Cloud Storage, or StorageGRID (private cloud).

== Pricing and licenses

The Application Templates feature requires no licensing and is free to use by all Cloud Manager users.

== How Application Templates work

Application Templates is a NetApp-managed service that uses FabricPool technology to automatically tier inactive (cold) data from your on-premises ONTAP clusters to object storage in your public cloud or private cloud. Connections to ONTAP take place from a Connector.

The following image shows the relationship between each component:

At a high level, Templates work like this:

. NetApp creates a "Resource Template" for a certain resource type.
+
For example, a template to create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP volume or Azure NetApp Files volume.
. Your storage architect selects the Resource Template and creates an Application Template by hard-coding certain values for the listed parameters.
+
For example, they select a high speed disk and a large capacity for Cloud Volumes ONTAP volumes that will be used to carry the workloads for Oracle databases.
. Your storage admins Cloud Manager configures ONTAP to use the object storage provider and discovers the amount of active and inactive data on the cluster.
.
. The template enforces certain resource settings by using the "drift" feature.
