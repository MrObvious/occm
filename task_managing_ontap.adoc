The Active IQ page in Cloud Manager shows you any undiscovered ONTAP clusters in your on-premises environment, whether any clusters require new firmware to be installed, and if they are using all the licenses that you have paid for. This information is provided to Cloud Manager from the link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/index.html[Active IQ Digital Advisor^].

== Checking for on-premises clusters that have not been added to Cloud Manager

.Steps

. Click the *Active IQ* tab, enter your NetApp Support Site user name and password, and click *Save*.

== Viewing and using unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses

Many on-premises ONTAP cluster packages that you have purchased include a free Cloud Volumes ONTAP license so you can try the NetApp cloud storage offerings. The license can be used to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance or it can be applied to an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP instance to extend the term of the license.

You can see whether you have any unused Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses based on your NetApp Support Site credentials.

.Steps

. From the Active IQ page, click the *Licenses* tab.

== Checking for new disk and shelf firmware

You can see whether any of your discovered ONTAP clusters need to have their shelf or disk firmware updated.
And you can download the zip file that you can use to update the firmware.

*Note:* The ability to view and download new firmware is available only when you have subscribed to certain support plans.

.Steps

. From the Active IQ page, click the *Firmware Updates* tab.
+
A *Download* button appears for the clusters that are not using the most recent firmware.

. Click *Download* for each cluster that needs updated firmware and save the zip file.

. See the following instructions to link:https://aiq.netapp.com/assets/docs/Quick_Reference_Guide.pdf[update your storage system firmware].

.Result

Your firmware is updated. The next time your ONTAP system sends an AutoSupport message to Active IQ, the status in the _Firmware Updates_ page will be updated to show that updates are no longer needed.
