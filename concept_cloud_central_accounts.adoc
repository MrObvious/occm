[.lead]
Each Cloud Manager system is associated with a _NetApp Cloud Central account_. A Cloud Central account is a container for the _workspaces_ in which users deploy Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

A Cloud Central account enables multi-tenancy. Multiple users can use a single instance of Cloud Manager software to deploy and manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in isolated environments called workspaces. These workspaces are invisible to other users, unless they are shared.

You can create as many Cloud Central accounts as you need for your business. You might have one, or a few. For example, you might have two Cloud Manager systems, each deployed in separate Cloud Central accounts to serve different business needs.

When you deploy Cloud Manager, you select the Cloud Central account to associate with the system:

You can then modify the settings for this account by managing users, workspaces, and service connectors:

== Users, workspaces, and service connectors

The Account Settings widget in Cloud Manager enables Account Admins to manage a Cloud Central account. If you just created your account, then you'll start from scratch. But if you've already set up an account, then you'll see _all_ the users, workspaces, and service connectors that are associated with the account.

Users::
These are NetApp Cloud Central users that you associate with your Cloud Central account. Associating a user with an account and one or more workspaces in that account enables those users to create and manage working environments in Cloud Manager.
+
When you associate a user, you assign them a role:
+
* _Account admin_: Can perform any action in Cloud Manager.
* _Workspace admin_: Can create and manage resources in the assigned workspace.

Workspaces::
In Cloud Manager, a workspace isolates any number of _working environments_ from other working environments. Workspace admins can't access the working environments in a workspace unless the Account admin associates the admin with that workspace.
+
A working environment represents a storage system:
+
* A single-node Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or an HA pair
* An on-premises ONTAP cluster in your network
* An ONTAP cluster in a NetApp Private Storage configuration

Service connectors::
A service connector resides in your network and enables communication with NetApp cloud data services. For Cloud Manager, the service connector is the Cloud Manager system itself.
+
You can use a service connector with more than one NetApp cloud data service. For example, you can use the same service connector with Cloud Manager and Cloud Tiering. Deploy a Cloud Manager system and select its service connector in Cloud Tiering when you set up cold data from ONTAP clusters to object storage.

== Examples

The following example shows an account that uses two workspaces to create isolated environments for Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. For example, one workspace might be for a staging environment, while the other is for a production environment.

NOTE: Cloud Manager and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't actually reside _in_ the NetApp Cloud Central account--they're running in a cloud provider. This is a conceptual representation of the relationship between each component.

Here's another example that shows the highest level of multi-tenancy by using two separate Cloud Central accounts. For example, a service provider might use Cloud Manager in one Cloud Central account to provide services for their customers, while using another account to provide disaster recovery for one of their business units.

Note that account 2 includes two separate Cloud Manager systems (service connectors). This might happen if you have systems in separate regions or in separate cloud providers.

NOTE: Again, Cloud Manager and the Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems don't actually reside _in_ the NetApp Cloud Central account--they're running in a cloud provider. This is a conceptual representation of the relationship between each component.

== FAQ for integrating existing systems with Cloud Central accounts

Some time after you upgrade to Cloud Manager 3.7, NetApp will choose specific Cloud Manager systems to integrate with Cloud Central accounts. This FAQ can answer questions that you might have about the process.

=== How long does the process take?

Just a few minutes.

=== Will Cloud Manager be unavailable?

No, you can still access your Cloud Manager system.

=== What about Cloud Volumes ONTAP?

There's no disruption to your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems.

=== What happens during this process?

NetApp does the following during the integration process:

. Creates a new Cloud Central account and associates it with your Cloud Manager system.

. Assigns new roles to each existing user:
+
* Cloud Manager Admins become Account Admins
* Tenant Admins and Working Environment Admins become Workspace Admins

. Creates workspaces that replace existing tenants.

. Places your working environments in those workspaces.

. Associates the Service Connector with all workspaces.

=== Does it matter where I installed my Cloud Manager system?

No. NetApp will integrate systems with Cloud Central accounts no matter where they reside, whether that's in AWS, Azure, or on your premises.
