Backups are stored in an object store in your cloud account so that you can restore data from a specific point in time. You can restore entire volumes or up to 8 individual files (at a time) from a saved backup file.

Restoring an entire volume is part of the Backup to Cloud service that you used to create the backup file. Once you have activated the Backup to Cloud service in a working environment, you can restore an entire volume in the same working environment, or to a different working environment, that's using the same cloud account. See <<Restoring a volume from a backup,Restoring a volume from a backup>>.

Restoring individual files from a backup file actually uses two services. It uses the Backup to Cloud service to create the backup file just like described above. But when you initiate a single file restore it uses the Restore service to perform the operation. Again, you can restore files to a volume in the same working environment, or to a different working environment, that's using the same cloud account. See <<Restoring files from a backup,Restoring files from a backup>>.

TIP: Backups created from on-premises ONTAP systems can be restored only to Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems that use the same cloud provider as where the backup resides.

== Restoring a volume from a backup

When you restore a volume from a backup file, Cloud Manager creates a _new_ volume using the data from the backup. You can restore the data to a volume in the same working environment or to a different working environment that's located in the same cloud account as the source working environment. Because the backup does not contain any snapshots, the newly restored volume does not either.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *View Backups*.

. Select the row for the volume that you want to restore and click *View Backup List*.

. Find the backup that you want to restore and click the *Restore* icon.

. Fill out the _Restore Backup to new volume_ page:
.. Select the working environment to which you want to restore the volume.
.. Enter a name for the volume.
.. Click *Restore*.

.Result

Cloud Manager creates a new volume based on the backup you selected. You can link:task_managing_storage.html#managing-existing-volumes[manage this new volume^] as required.

== Restoring files from a backup

Restoring individual files from a backup file uses the Restore service to perform the operation. You can restore files to a volume in the same working environment, or to a different working environment, that's using the same cloud account. You can restore up to 8 files from a backup file.

The process goes like this:

. You activate the Restore service from the Services panel.
+
A Restore instance is deployed in your cloud providers' environment, but then it is shut down.

. When you need to restore one or more files from a volume (from a backup file), you click the Restore tab and select the backup file (the snapshot) where the file reside.
+
The Restore instance starts up and displays the folders and files that exist in the backup file.

. You choose the file (or up to 8 files) from that backup, select the location where you want the file(s) to be written (working environment, volume, folder), and click Restore.
+
The Restore instance restores the file(s), and then the instance is shut down after a short inactivity period.

.Requirements

* The Backup to Cloud service must already be activated for this working environment.

* At least one backup file must exist for the working environment.

* dfg

.Costs

* The Restore instance

=== Activating the Restore service

This is a one-time operation to create the Restore instance.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click the *Activate* button from the Restore service.

A Restore instance is deployed in your cloud providers' environment, and then it is shut down.

=== Restoring a single file from a backup file

Follow these steps to restore up to 8 files from a volume backup to a new volume. Note that the wording in the UI calls each backup files a "snapshot" because backup files are created using NetApp Snapshot technology.

.Steps

. Click the *Restore* tab.
+
The Restore inventory page appears.
+

. Click the *Restore Files* button.

. Select the *Working Environment*, the *Volume*, and the *Snapshot* that has the date/time stamp from which you want to restore files.
+

. Click *Continue* and the Restore instance is started. After a few minutes the Restore instance displays the list of folders and files from the volume snapshot.

. Select the file or files that you want to restore.
* You can click the search icon and enter the name of the file to navigate directly to the file.
* You can click the file name if you see it.
* You can navigate down level in folder to find the file.

. Then
