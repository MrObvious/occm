Backups are stored in an object store in your cloud account so that you can restore data from a specific point in time. You can restore an entire volume from a saved backup file, or if you only need to restore a few files, you can restore up to 8 individual files (at one time) from a saved backup file.

You can restore an entire volume to the same working environment, to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system. See <<Restoring a volume from a backup,Restoring a volume from a backup>>.

You can restore files to a volume in the same working environment, to a volume in a different working environment that's using the same cloud account, or to a volume on an on-premises ONTAP system. See <<Restoring files from a backup,Restoring files from a backup>>.

== Supported working environments and object storage providers

You can restore a volume, or individual files, from a backup file to the following working environments:

== Enabling the Restore service

You must enable the Restore service for each working environment.

NOTE: The Backup to Cloud service must already be activated for this working environment.

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the working environment.

. Click the *Enable* button for the Restore service.
+

You are directed to the Restore page under the Restore tab.

== Restoring a volume from a backup file

When you restore a volume from a backup file, Cloud Manager creates a _new_ volume using the data from the backup. You can restore the data to a volume in the same working environment or to a different working environment that's located in the same cloud account as the source working environment. You can also restore files to an on-premises ONTAP system.

You should know the name of the volume you want to restore and the date of the backup file you want to use to create the newly restored volume.

.Steps

. Select the *Restore* tab.
+
The Restore Dashboard appears.

. Click *Restore Volumes*.
+
image:screenshot_restore_volume_selection.png[A screenshot of selecting the Restore Volumes button from the Restore Dashboard.]

. In the _Select Source_ page, navigate to the backup file (snapshot) for the volume you want to restore. Select the *Working Environment*, the *Volume*, and the *Snapshot* that has the date/time stamp that you want to restore.
+
image:screenshot_restore_select_volume_snapshot.png[A screenshot of selecting the working environment, volume, and volume snapshot that you want to restore.]

. Click *Continue*.

. In the _Select Destination_ page, select the *Working Environment* where you want to restore the volume.
+
image:screenshot_restore_select_work_env_volume.png[A screenshot of selecting the destination working environment for the volume you want to restore.]
+
. If you select an on-premises ONTAP system and you haven't already configured the cluster connection to the object storage, you are prompted for additional information:
+
* When restoring from Amazon S3, enter IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volumes reside, and the AWS Access Key and Secret Key needed to access the object storage.
* When restoring from Azure Blob, enter the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volumes reside.
* When restoring from Google Cloud Storage, enter IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volumes reside, and the Access Key and Secret Key needed to access the object storage.

. Select the Storage VM where the volume will reside and enter the name you want to use for the restored volume. By default, *<source_volume_name>_Restore* is used as the volume name.
+
image:screenshot_restore_new_vol_name.png[A screenshot of selecting the volume and folder for the files you want to restore.]
+
You can select the Aggregate that the volume will use for its' capacity when restoring a volume to an on-prem ONTAP system.

. Click *Restore* and you are returned to the Restore Dashboard so you can review the progress of the restore operation.

.Result

Cloud Manager creates a new volume based on the backup you selected. You can link:task_managing_storage.html#managing-existing-volumes[manage this new volume^] as required.

== Restoring files from a backup

If you only need to restore a few files from a volume, you can choose to restore individual files instead of restoring the entire volume. You can restore files to a volume in the same working environment, or to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account. You can also restore files to an on-premises ONTAP system.

You can restore up to 8 files at a time from a volume in a backup file. All the files are restored to the same destination volume that you choose. If you need to restore more than 8 files you can run the restore process a second time.

NOTE: Restoring individual files from a backup file uses a separate Restore instance/virtual machine.

=== File Restore process

The process goes like this:

. When you want to restore one or more files from a volume, click the Restore tab and select the backup file in which the file (or files) reside.

. The Restore instance starts up and displays the folders and files that exist within the backup file.
+
*Note:* The Restore instance is deployed in your cloud providers' environment the first time you restore a file.

. Choose the file (or files) that you want to restore from that backup.

. Select the location where you want the file(s) to be restored (the working environment, volume, and folder), and click Restore.

. The Restore instance restores the file(s), and then the instance is shut down to save costs after a period of inactivity.

=== Details

.Costs

See link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#cost[this topic^] for the cost of the Backup to Cloud service and the Restore instance.

.Instance type

* In AWS, the Restore instance runs on an https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m5/[m5n.xlarge instance^] with 4 CPUs, 16 GiB Memory, and EBS Only instance storage. In regions where m5n.xlarge instance isnâ€™t available, Restore runs on an m5.xlarge instance instead.

* In Azure, the Restore virtual machine runs on a https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/dv3-dsv3-series#dsv3-series[Standard_D4s_v3 VM^] with 4 CPUs, 16 GiB Memory, and a 32 GB disk.

.AWS permissions required

When using Restore with AWS, the IAM role that provides Cloud Manager with permissions must include S3 permissions from the latest https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/info/cloud-manager-policies[Cloud Manager policy^] as described in link:task_backup_to_s3.html#requirements[AWS requirements^].

Additionally, the following permissions are needed in the policy for file restore:

[source,json]
  "Action": [
    "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypeOfferings",
    "ec2:startInstances",
    "ec2:stopInstances",
    "ec2:terminateInstances"
  ],

.Access

The Restore instance requires outbound internet access to manage resources and processes within your public cloud environment.

=== Restoring a single file from a backup file

Follow these steps to restore up to 8 files from a volume backup to a volume. You should know the date of the backup file you want to use to restore the file, or files. This functionality uses Live Browsing so that you can view the current list of directories and files within the backup file.

Note that the wording in the UI calls each backup file a "snapshot" because backup files are created using NetApp Snapshot technology.

The following video shows a quick walkthrough of restoring a single file:

NOTE: The ONTAP version must be 9.6 or greater in your source and destination ONTAP systems.

.Steps

. Click the *Restore* tab.
+
The Restore Dashboard appears.

. Click the *Restore Files* button.
+
image:screenshot_restore_files_selection.png[A screenshot of selecting the Restore Volumes button from the Restore Dashboard.]

. In the _Select Source_ page, navigate to the backup file (snapshot) for the volume that contains the files you want to restore. Select the *Working Environment*, the *Volume*, and the *Snapshot* that has the date/time stamp from which you want to restore files.
+
image:screenshot_restore_select_source.png[A screenshot of selecting the volume and snapshot for the files you want to restore.]

. Click *Continue* and the Restore instance is started. After a few minutes the Restore instance displays the list of folders and files from the volume snapshot.
+
*Note:* The Restore instance is deployed in your cloud providers' environment the first time you restore a file, so this step could take a few minutes longer the first time.
+
image:screenshot_restore_select_files.png[A screenshot of the Select Files page so you can navigate to the files you want to restore.]

. In the _Select Files_ page, select the file or files that you want to restore and click *Continue*.
* You can click the search icon and enter the name of the file to navigate directly to the file.
* You can click the file name if you see it.
* You can navigate down levels in folders using the image:button_subfolder.png[] button at the end of the row to find the file.
+
As you select files they are added to the left side of the page so you can see the files that you have already chosen. You can remove a file from this list if needed by clicking the *x* next to the file name.

. In the _Select Destination_ page, select the *Working Environment* where you want to restore the files.
+
image:screenshot_restore_select_work_env.png[A screenshot of selecting the destination working environment for the files you want to restore.]
+
If you select an on-premises cluster and you haven't already configured the cluster connection to the object storage, you are prompted for additional information:
+
* When restoring from Amazon S3, enter IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volumes reside, and the AWS Access Key and Secret Key needed to access the object storage.
* When restoring from Azure Blob, enter the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volumes reside.
* When restoring from Google Cloud Storage, enter IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volumes reside, and the Access Key and Secret Key needed to access the object storage.

. Then select the *Volume* and the *Folder* where you want to restore the files.
+
image:screenshot_restore_select_dest.png[A screenshot of selecting the volume and folder for the files you want to restore.]
+
You have a few options for the location when restoring files.

+
* When you have chosen *Select Target Folder*, as shown above:
+
** You can select any folder.
** You can hover over a folder and click image:button_subfolder.png[] at the end of the row to drill down into subfolders, and then select a folder.

+
* If you have selected the same Working Environment and Volume as the source file (as identified by the image:button_source.png[] icon), you can select *Maintain Source Folder Path* to restore the file, or all files, to the same folder where they existed in the source structure. All the same folders and sub-folders must exist; folders are not created.

. Click *Restore* and you are returned to the Restore Dashboard so you can review the progress of the restore operation.

The Restore instance is shut down after a certain period of inactivity to save you money so that you incur costs only when it is active.
