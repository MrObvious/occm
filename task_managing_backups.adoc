Manage backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems by changing the backup schedule, restoring volumes, deleting backups, and more.

== Changing the schedule and backup retention

The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. You can change to weekly or monthly backups and you can change the number of backup copies to retain. You can also select one of the system-defined policies that provide scheduled backups for 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years.

TIP: Changing the backup policy affects only new volumes created after you change the schedule. It doesn't affect the schedule for any existing volumes.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *Backup Settings*.

== Restoring a volume from a backup

When you restore data from a backup, Cloud Manager performs a full volume restore to a _new_ volume. You can restore the data to the same working environment or to a different working environment that's located in the same AWS account as the source working environment.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *View Backups*.
+

. Select the volume that you want to restore.

. Click *View Backup List* and find the backup that you want to restore and click the *Restore* icon.
+

. Fill out the _Restore Backup to new volume_ page:
.. Select the working environment to which you want to restore the volume.
.. Enter a name for the volume.
.. Click *Restore*.

.Result

Cloud Manager creates a new volume based on the backup you selected. You can link:task_managing_storage.html#managing-existing-volumes[manage this new volume] as required.

== Deleting backups

Backup to Cloud enables you to delete _all_ backups of a specific volume. You can't delete _individual_ backups.

You might do this if you deleted a volume or if you deleted a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. Backup to Cloud doesn't automatically delete backups when you delete a volume or when you delete a system.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Backup*.

. From the volume list, find the volume and click *View Backup List*.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *Delete All Backups*.
+

.Result

Cloud Manager deletes all backups for the selected volume.

== Disabling Backup to Cloud

Disabling Backup to Cloud for a working environment disables backups of each volume on the system. Any existing backups will not be deleted.

Note that you'll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that your backups use unless you delete the backups.

.Steps

. Select the working environment.

. Click image:screenshot_gallery_options.gif[More icon] and select *Backup Settings*.
+

. From the _Backup to Cloud Settings page_, disable *Automatically back up all volumes* and then click *Save*.
