Manage backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP by changing the backup schedule, restoring volumes, update BYOL licenses, and more.

== Changing the schedule and backup retention

The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. You can change to weekly or monthly backups and you can change the number of backup copies to retain. You can also select one of the system-defined policies that provide scheduled backups for 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years.

TIP: Changing the backup policy affects all future backups. It doesn't affect any previous backups that were created.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Click the backup settings icon.

== Restoring a volume

When you restore data from a backup, Cloud Manager performs a full volume restore to a _new_ volume. You can restore the data to the same working environment or to a different working environment that's located in the same AWS account as the source working environment.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Backup*.

. Select the volume that you want to restore.

. Enter a name for the volume.

. Click *Restore*.

== Adding and updating your Backup BYOL license

You use the BYOL Licenses page to add or update your Backup BYOL license.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click the menu icon and then click *License*.

. Enter the license information and click *Add License*:
* If you have the serial number, select the *Enter Backup BYOL Serial Number* option and enter the serial number.
* If you have the backup license file, select the *Upload Backup BYOL License* option and follow the prompts to attach the file.

.Result

Cloud Manager adds or updates the license so that your Backup to Cloud service is active.

== Deleting backups

Backup to Cloud enables you to delete _all_ backups of a specific volume. You can't delete _individual_ backups.

You might do this if you deleted a volume or if you deleted a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. Backup to Cloud doesn't automatically delete backups when you delete a volume or when you delete a system.

.Steps

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Backup*.

. Click *View Backup List* for a volume.

. Click the menu and select *Delete All Backups*.

.Result

Cloud Manager deletes all backups for the selected volume.

== Disabling Backup to Cloud

Disabling Backup to Cloud disables backups of each volume on the system. Any existing backups will not be deleted.

Note that you'll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that your backups use unless you delete the backups.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Click the backup settings icon.

. Disable *Automatically back up all volumes* and then click *Save*.
