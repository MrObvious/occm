You can manage backups for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems by changing the backup schedule, enabling/disabling volume backups, deleting backups, and more.

== Viewing the volumes that are being backed up

You can view a list of all the volumes that are currently being backed up in the Backup Dashboard.

.Steps

. Click the *Backup & Restore* tab.

. Click the *Backup* tab and the Backup Dashboard is displayed.

If you are looking for specific volumes in certain working environments, you can refine the list by working environment and volume, or you can use the search filter.

== Changing the schedule and backup retention

The default policy backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies of each volume. You can change to a combination of daily, weekly, or monthly backups and you can change the number of backup copies to retain. You can also select one of the system-defined policies that provide scheduled backups for 3 months, 1 year, and 7 years.

Changing the backup policy affects both new volumes created after you change the schedule, and any existing volumes that were using the original policy.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.

. From the _Modify Backup Policy_ page, change the schedule and backup retention and then click *Save*.

== Starting and stopping backups of volumes

You can stop backing up a volume if you do not need backup copies of that volume and you do not want to pay for the cost to store the backups. You can also add a new volume to the backup list if it is not currently being backed up.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.
+

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment and select *Manage Volumes*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_manage_volumes.png[A screenshot that shows the Manage Volumes button from the Backup Settings page.]

. Select the checkbox for volumes that you want to start backing up, and deselect the checkbox for volumes that you want to stop backing up.

*Note:* When stopping a volume from being backed up you’ll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that the backups use unless you <<Deleting backups,delete the backups>>.

== Viewing the list of backups for each volume

You can view the list of all backup files (snapshots) that exist for each volume. This page displays details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details such as last backup taken, the current backup policy, and more.

This page also enables you perform the following tasks:

* Delete all backup files (snapshots) for the volume
* Delete individual backup files for the volume
* Download a backup report for the volume

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the source volume and select *Details & Snapshot List*.
+

The list of all backup files (snapshots) is displayed along with details about the source volume, destination location, and backup details.

== Deleting backups

Cloud Backup enables you to delete _all_ backups of a specific volume. You can't delete _individual_ backups. You might do this if you no longer need the backups or if you deleted the source volume and want to remove all backups.

Note that deleting all backups also disables any further backups of this volume. If you later want to start creating backups of that volume, you can re-enable backups <<Starting and stopping backups of volumes,as described here>>.

IMPORTANT: If you plan to delete a Cloud Volumes ONTAP or on-premises ONTAP system that has backups, you must delete the backups *before* deleting the system. Cloud Backup doesn’t automatically delete backups when you delete a system, and there is no current support in the UI to delete the backups after the system has been deleted.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_settings_button.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup Settings button which is available after you select a working environment.]

. Click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment where you want to delete all backups and select *Delete All Backups*.
+
image:screenshot_delete_all_backups.png[A screenshot of selecting the Delete All Backups button to delete all backup for a volume.]

. In the confirmation dialog box, click *Delete*.

== Disabling Cloud Backup

Disabling Cloud Backup for a working environment disables backups of each volume on the system, and it also disables the ability to restore a volume. Any existing backups will not be deleted.

Note that you'll continue to be charged by your cloud provider for object storage costs for the capacity that your backups use unless you delete the backups.

.Steps

. From the Backup Dashboard, select *Backup Settings*.

. From the _Backup Settings page_, click image:screenshot_horizontal_more_button.gif[More icon] for the working environment where you want to disable backups and select *Deactivate Backup*.
