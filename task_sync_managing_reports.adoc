Create and view reports to get information that you can use with the help of NetApp personnel to tune a data broker’s configuration and improve performance.

Each report provides in-depth details about a path in a sync relationship. For example, the report for a file system shows how many directories and files there are, the distribution of file size, how deep and wide the directories are, and more.

== Creating and viewing reports about paths

Create a new report for a path at any time.

.Steps

. Click *Sync > Reports*.
+
The paths (source or target) in each of your sync relationships display in a table.

. In the *Reports Actions* column, click the action menu for a path and select *Create New*.

. When the report is ready, click *View*.
+
Here's a sample report for a file system path.

== Viewing report errors

The Paths table identifies whether any errors are present in the most recent report. View the report errors, address any issues, and then run the report again.

.Steps

. Click *Sync > Reports*.

. In the *Errors* column, identify whether any errors are present in a report.

. If errors are present, click the action menu and select *View*.

. In the report, click the action menu and select *View errors*.

. Use the information in the error to correct the issue.
+
After you resolve the issue, the error shouldn't appear the next time that you run the report.

== Deleting reports

Delete any reports that you no longer need.

.Steps

. Click *Sync > Reports*.

. In the *Reports Actions* column, click the action menu for a path and select *Delete last report* or *Delete all reports*.

. Confirm that you want to delete the report or reports.
