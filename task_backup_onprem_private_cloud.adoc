Complete a few steps to get started backing up data from your on-premises ONTAP systems to object storage in your NetApp StorageGRID systems.

== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps, or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Verify support for your configuration

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* You have a Connector installed on your premises.
** Networking for the Connector enables an outbound HTTPS connection to the ONTAP cluster and to StorageGRID.
* You have discovered the on-premises cluster and added it to a working environment in Cloud Manager. See link:task_discovering_ontap.html[Discovering ONTAP clusters^] for details.
** The cluster is running ONTAP 9.7P5 or later.
** The cluster has a SnapMirror license -- it is included as part of the PREM or Data Protection bundle.
* You have purchased link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[and activated^] a Cloud Backup BYOL license from NetApp.
* Your StorageGRID has version 10.3 or later with access keys that have S3 permissions.

=== Preparing your ONTAP clusters

Your ONTAP clusters must meet the following requirements when backing up data to cloud storage.

ONTAP requirements::
* ONTAP 9.7P5 and later.
* A SnapMirror license (included as part of the PREM or Data Protection bundle).
+
See how to http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-sag/GUID-76A429CC-56CF-4DC1-9DC5-A3E222892684.html[manage your cluster licenses^].
*	Time and time zone are set correctly.
+
See how to http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-sag/GUID-644CED2B-ABC9-4FC5-BEB2-1BE6A867919E.html[configure your cluster time^].

Cluster networking requirements::
* The ONTAP cluster initiates an HTTPS connection over a user-specified port to StorageGRID (the port is configurable during backup setup).
+
ONTAP reads and writes data to and from object storage. The object storage never initiates, it just responds.
+
* An inbound connection is required from the Connector, which must reside on your premises.

* An intercluster LIF is required on each ONTAP node that hosts the volumes you want to back up. The LIF must be associated with the _IPspace_ that ONTAP should use to connect to object storage. http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-69120CF0-F188-434F-913E-33ACB8751A5D.html[Learn more about IPspaces^].
+
When you set up Cloud Backup, you are prompted for the IPspace to use. You should choose the IPspace that each LIF is associated with. That might be the "Default" IPspace or a custom IPspace that you created.
*	DNS servers have been configured for the storage VM where the volumes are located.
+
See how to http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.dot-cm-nmg/GUID-D4A9F825-77F0-407F-BFBD-D94372D6AAC1.html[configure DNS services for the SVM^].
* Update firewall rules, if necessary, to allow Cloud Backup service connections from ONTAP to object storage through the port you specified (typically port 443) and name resolution traffic from the storage VM to the DNS server over port 53 (TCP/UDP).

=== Discovering an ONTAP cluster

You need to discover your on-premises ONTAP clusters in Cloud Manager before you can start backing up volume data.

link:task_discovering_ontap.html[Learn how to discover a cluster^].

=== Preparing StorageGRID

StorageGRID must meet the following requirements. See the https://docs.netapp.com/sgws-114/index.jsp[StorageGRID documentation^] for more information.

Supported StorageGRID versions::
StorageGRID 10.3 and later is supported.

S3 credentials::
When you set up backup to StorageGRID, you need to provide Cloud Backup with an S3 access key and secret key for a service account. A service account enables Cloud Backup to authenticate and access the StorageGRID buckets used to store backups. The keys are required so that StorageGRID knows who is making the request.
+
These access keys must be associated with a user who has the following permissions:
+
[source,json]
"s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
"s3:ListBucket",
"s3:GetObject",
"s3:PutObject",
"s3:DeleteObject",
"s3:CreateBucket"

Object versioning::
You must not enable StorageGRID object versioning on the object store bucket.

=== Creating or switching Connectors

When backing up data to StorageGRID, a Connector must be available on your premises. You'll either need to install a new Connector or make sure that the currently selected Connector resides on-prem.

* link:concept_connectors.html[Learn about Connectors]
* link:reference_cloud_mgr_reqs.html[Connector host requirements]
* link:task_installing_linux.html[Installing the Connector on an existing Linux host]
* link:task_managing_connectors.html[Switching between Connectors]

=== Preparing networking for the Connector

Ensure that the Connector has the required networking connections.

.Steps

. Ensure that the network where the Connector is installed enables the following connections:

* An outbound internet connection to the Cloud Backup service over port 443 (HTTPS)
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to StorageGRID
* An HTTPS connection over port 443 to your ONTAP clusters

=== License requirements

For Cloud Backup BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. See link:task_managing_licenses.html#adding-and-updating-your-backup-byol-license[Adding and updating your Backup BYOL license^].

PAYGO licensing is not currently supported when backing up files to StorageGRID.

== Enabling Cloud Backup to StorageGRID

Enable Cloud Backup at any time directly from the on-premises working environment.

.Steps

. From the Canvas, select the on-premises working environment and click *Enable* next to the Backup & Compliance service in the right-panel.
+
image:screenshot_backup_from_onprem_activate.png[A screenshot that shows the Backup & Compliance Enable button which is available after you select an on-prem working environment.]

. Select *StorageGRID* as the provider, click *Next*, and then enter the provider details:

.. The FQDN of the StorageGRID server, Access Key, and the Secret Key used to access the bucket to store backups.
.. The IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside.
+
Selecting the correct IPspace ensures that Cloud Backup can set up a connection from ONTAP to your StorageGRID object storage.
+
image:screenshot_backup_provider_settings_storagegrid.png[A screenshot that shows the cloud provider details when backing up volumes from an on-premises cluster to StorageGRID storage.]
+
Note that you cannot change this information after the service has started.

. In the _Define Policy_ page, select the backup schedule and retention value and click *Next*.
+
image:screenshot_backup_onprem_policy.png[A screenshot that shows the Cloud Backup settings where you can choose your backup schedule and retention period.]
+
See link:concept_backup_to_cloud.html#the-schedule-is-daily-weekly-monthly-or-a-combination[the list of existing policies^].

. Select the volumes that you want to back up.

+
* To back up all volumes, check the box in the title row (image:button_backup_all_volumes.png[]).
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume (image:button_backup_1_volume.png[]).
+
image:screenshot_backup_select_volumes.png[A screenshot of selecting the volumes that will be backed up.]

. Click *Activate Backup* and Cloud Backup starts taking the initial backups of each selected volume and the Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups.

.Result

Cloud Backup backs up your volumes from the on-premises ONTAP system.
