You can scan your on-premises ONTAP data with Cloud Compliance by replicating the on-prem NFS or CIFS data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and then enabling compliance. Scanning the data directly from an on-premises ONTAP working environment isn't supported.

.Steps

. From Cloud Manager, create a SnapMirror relationship between the on-premises ONTAP cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html[Create a SnapMirror replication between the on-premises ONTAP cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP from Cloud Manager].

. From the ONTAP CLI, configure the destination volume for data access.

.	From Cloud Manager, activate Cloud Compliance on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment that contains the SnapMirror data.

.. Click *Working Environments*.
.. Select the working environment that contains the SnapMirror data.
.. In the pane on the right, click *Enable Compliance*.
