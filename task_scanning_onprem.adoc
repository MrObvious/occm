You can scan data on your on-premises ONTAP systems directly using Cloud Compliance. You can also replicate the on-prem NFS or CIFS data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and then enable compliance for those data protection volumes. Choose whichever way works best for you.

== Scanning data in on-premises ONTAP working environments

If you have link:task_discovering_ontap.html[discovered your ONTAP clusters^] and added them to a working environment in Cloud Manager, you can scan volume data directly from those on-prem clusters.

Complete a few steps to get started with Cloud Compliance for on-premises ONTAP clusters.

=== Quick start

Get started quickly by following these steps or scroll down to the remaining sections for full details.

==== image:number1.png[Number 1] Deploy the Cloud Compliance instance

[role="quick-margin-para"]
link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[Deploy Cloud Compliance in Cloud Manager^] if there isn't already an instance deployed.

==== image:number2.png[Number 2] Enable Cloud Compliance in your on-prem working environments and select the volumes to scan

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Click *Compliance*, select the *Configuration* tab, and activate compliance scans for all volumes or just specific volumes.

==== image:number3.png[Number 3] Ensure access to volumes

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Now that Cloud Compliance is enabled, ensure that it can access all volumes.

[role="quick-margin-list"]
* The Cloud Compliance instance needs a network connection to each on-prem ONTAP system.
* Security groups must allow inbound connections from the Cloud Compliance instance.
* NFS volume export policies must allow access from the Cloud Compliance instance.
* Cloud Compliance needs Active Directory credentials to scan CIFS volumes.
+
Click *Compliance* > *Scan Configuration* > *Edit CIFS Credentials* and provide the credentials.

==== image:number4.png[Number 4]  Manage the volumes you are scanning

[role="quick-margin-para"]
Select or deselect the volumes that you want to scan and Cloud Compliance will start or stop scanning them.

=== Deploying the Cloud Compliance instance

link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[Deploy Cloud Compliance^] if there isn't already an instance deployed.

Cloud Compliance can be deployed in the cloud or in an on-premises location when scanning on-premises ONTAP clusters.

=== Enabling Cloud Compliance in your working environments

. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Compliance* and then select the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_compliance_ontap_we_scan_config.png[A screenshot of the Scan Configuration tab immediately after deploying the Cloud Compliance instance.]

. To scan all volumes in a working environment, click *Activate Compliance for All Volumes*.
+
To scan only certain volumes in a working environment, click *or select Volumes* and then choose the volumes you want to scan.
+
See link:task_getting_started_compliance.html#enabling-and-disabling-compliance-scans-on-volumes[Enabling and disabling compliance scans on volumes] for details.

.Result

Cloud Compliance starts scanning the volumes you selected in the working environment. Results will be available in the Compliance dashboard as soon as Cloud Compliance finishes the initial scans. The time that it takes depends on the amount of data--it could be a few minutes or hours.

== Verifying that Cloud Compliance has access to volumes

Make sure that Cloud Compliance can access volumes by checking your networking, security groups, and export policies. You'll need to provide Cloud Compliance with CIFS credentials so it can access CIFS volumes.

.Steps

. Make sure that there's a network connection between the Cloud Compliance instance and each network that includes volumes for on-prem ONTAP systems.

. Ensure that the security group for the on-prem ONTAP systems allow inbound traffic from the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
You can do this by opening the security group for traffic from the IP address of the Cloud Compliance instance.

. Ensure that NFS volume export policies include the IP address of the Cloud Compliance instance so it can access the data on each volume.

. If you use CIFS, provide Cloud Compliance with Active Directory credentials so it can scan CIFS volumes.

.. At the top of Cloud Manager, click *Compliance*.

.. Click the *Configuration* tab.
+
image:screenshot_cifs_credentials.gif[A screenshot of the Compliance tab that shows the Scan Status button that's available in the top right of the content pane.]

.. For each working environment, click *Edit CIFS Credentials* and enter the user name and password that Cloud Compliance needs to access CIFS volumes on the system.
+
The credentials can be read-only, but providing admin credentials ensures that Cloud Compliance can read any data that requires elevated permissions. The credentials are stored on the Cloud Compliance instance.
+
After you enter the credentials, you should see a message that all CIFS volumes were authenticated successfully.
+

. On the _Scan Configuration_ page, click *View Details* to review the status for each CIFS and NFS volume and correct any errors.
+
For example, the following image shows three volumes; one of which Cloud Compliance can't scan due to network connectivity issues between the Cloud Compliance instance and the volume.

== Scanning on-premises ONTAP data by using SnapMirror

You can scan your on-premises ONTAP data with Cloud Compliance by replicating the on-prem NFS or CIFS data to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment and then enabling compliance on those data protection volumes.

TIP:: We recommend that you discover your on-prem ONTAP systems in Cloud Manager to add them to a working environment so that you can  link:task_scanning_onprem.html#scanning-data-in-on-premises-ontap-working-environments[scan data on those system directly from Cloud Compliance].

You must have link:task_deploy_cloud_compliance.html[deployed an instance of Cloud Compliance in Cloud Manager already^].

.Steps

. From Cloud Manager, create a SnapMirror relationship between the on-premises ONTAP cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP.

.. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_discovering_ontap.html[Discover the on-premises cluster in Cloud Manager^].

.. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html[Create a SnapMirror replication between the on-premises ONTAP cluster and Cloud Volumes ONTAP from Cloud Manager^].

.	From Cloud Manager, activate Cloud Compliance on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP working environment that contains the SnapMirror data:
.. Click *Working Environments*.
.. Select the working environment that contains the SnapMirror data and click *Enable Compliance*.
+
link:task_getting_started_compliance.html[Click here if you need help with enabling Cloud Compliance on a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system^].

. Click the *Enable Access to DP volumes* button at the top of the _Scan Configuration_ page so that Cloud Compliance can access the DP volumes.
+
NFS volumes are enabled, but CIFS volumes require that you enter Active Directory Admin credentials.

. Activate each DP volume that you want to scan, or use the *Activate Compliance for all Volumes* control to enable all volumes, including all DP volumes.
