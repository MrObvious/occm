After you set up your working environment, you can create and manage Amazon FSx for ONTAP volumes, clones and snapshots, change tiering policies, and remove or delete FSx for ONTAP.

== Creating volumes

You can create NFS or SMB volumes in a new or existing FSx for ONTAP working environment.

//A Cloud Manager feature called "templates" enables you to create volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for certain applications; such as databases or streaming services. If your organization has created volume templates that you should use, follow <<Creating volumes from templates,these steps>>.

.Before you begin

* You need to have an active Connector in AWS with FSx for ONTAP permissions to create and manage volumes, replicate, or enable data services.

* If you want to use SMB, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory.

* You need to maintain an active AWS Connector connection while working with FSx for ONTAP in Cloud Manager.

* You must have the password for the FSx admin user on the FSx for ONTAP instance.

.Steps

. Open the Amazon FSx for ONTAP working environment.

. If you already have an active Connector with FSx for ONTAP permissions, enter the user name and password. If you don't have a Connector enabled, you'll be prompted to add one.

. Click the *Volumes* tab

. Click *Add Volume*.

. Provide the required information on each page:

.. *Volume Details and Protection*:

... Enter a name for your new volume.
... Enter the volume size. Note that the volume size will grow with usage.
... Select a snapshot policy. By default, a snapshot is taken every hour (keeping the last six copies), every day (keeping the last two copies), and every week (keeping the last two copies).
... Click *Next*.

.. *Protocol*: Select an NFS or CIFS volume protocol.
... For NFS:
* Select an Access Control policy.
* Select the NFS versions.
* Select a Custom Export Policy. Click the information icon for valid value criteria.

... For CIFS:
* Enter a Share Name.
* Enter users or groups separated by a semicolon.
* Select the permission level for the volume.
+

... Click *Next*.

TIP: If the CIFS server was not already configured in the working environment, you will be prompted to configure CIFS connectivity.

.. *Usage Profile and Tiering*:

... By default, the *Storage Efficiency* is disabled. You can change this setting to enable deduplication and compression. Enter a volume name and size, the VNet and subnet where the volume should reside, and optionally specify tags for the volume.
... Be default, *Tiering Policy* is set to *Snapshot Only*. You can select a different tiering policy based on your  needs.
... Click *Next*.

.. *Review*: Review your volume configuration. Click *Previous* to change settings or click *Add* to create the volume.

.Result

The new volume is added to the working environment.

== Mounting volumes

Access mounting instructions from within Cloud Manager so you can mount the volume to a host.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and select *Mount the volume* (for NFS and CIFS volumes) or *Target iQN* (for iSCSI).

. Follow the instructions to mount the volume.

== Editing a volume's size and tags

After you create a volume, you can modify its size and tags at any time.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and select *Edit*.

. Modify the size and tags as needed.

. Click *Apply*.

== Cloning the volume

After you create a volume, you can create a new read-write volume from a new Snapshot.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and select *Clone*.

. Enter a name for the cloned volume.

. Click *Clone*.

// .Result
//
// The volume is moved to the other capacity pool with no impact to the volume.

== Managing Snapshot copies

Snapshot copies provide a point-in-time copy of your volume. Create Snapshot copies, restore the data to a new volume, and delete Snapshot copies.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and choose one of the available options to manage Snapshot copies:

* *Create a Snapshot copy*
* *Restore from a Snapshot copy*

. Follow the prompts to complete the selected action.

== Changing the tiering policy

Change the tiering policy for the volume.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and select *Change Tiering policy*.

. Select a new volume tiering policy and click *Change*.

== Replicating data

You can replicate data between storage environments using Cloud Manager. To configure FSx for ONTAP replication, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_replicating_data.html[replicating data between systems^]

== Syncing data

You can create sync relationships using Cloud Sync in Cloud Manager. To configure sync relationships, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_sync_quick_start.html[create sync relationships.^]

//TIP: Drag-and-drop sync is not available in FSx for ONTAP at this time. You can manually configure sync relationships using the *Sync* menu.

== Deleting volumes

Delete the volumes that you no longer need.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and click *Delete*.

. Enter the working environment name and confirm that you want to delete the volume. It can take up to an hour before the volume is completely removed from Cloud Manager.

== Removing FSx for ONTAP from the workspace

You can remove FSx for ONTAP from Cloud Manager. It doesn't delete your FSx for ONTAP account or volumes. You can add FSx for ONTAP back to Cloud Manager at any time.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. At the top right of the page, select the actions menu and click *Remove from workspace*.
+

. Click *Remove* to remove FSx for ONTAP from Cloud Manager.

== Deleting the FSx for ONTAP working environment

You can delete the FSx for ONTAP from Cloud Manager.

WARNING: This action will delete all resources associated with the working environment. This action cannot be undone.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. At the top right of the page, select the actions menu and click *Delete*.
+
