After you set up your working environment, you can create and manage FSx for ONTAP accounts, capacity pools, volumes, and snapshots.

== Creating volumes

You can create NFS or SMB volumes in a new or existing Azure NetApp Files account.

A Cloud Manager feature called "templates" enables you to create volumes that are optimized for the workload requirements for certain applications; such as databases or streaming services. If your organization has created volume templates that you should use, follow <<Creating volumes from templates,these steps>>.

.Before you begin

* If you want to use SMB, you must have set up DNS and Active Directory.

* You need to maintin an active AWS Connector connection while working with FSx for ONTAP in Cloud Manager.

* You must have the password for the FSx admin user on the FSx for ONTAP instance.

.Steps

. Open the Amazon FSx for ONTAP working environment.

. Click the *Volumes* tab

. Click *Add Volume*.

. Provide the required information on each page:

.. *Volume Details and Protection*:

... Enter a name for your new volume.
... Enter the volume size. Note that the volume size will grow with usage.
... Select a snapshot policy. By default, a snapshot is taken every hour (keeping the last six copies), every day (keeping the last two copies), and every week (keeping the last two copies).
... Click *Next*.

... Click *Next*.

TIP: If the CIFS server was not already configured in the working environment, you will be prompted to configure CIFS connectivity.

.. *Usage Profile and Tiering*:

... By default, the *Storage Efficiency* is disabled. You can change this setting to enable depulication and compression. Enter a volume name and size, the VNet and subnet where the volume should reside, and optionally specify tags for the volume.
... Be default, *Tiering Policy* is set to *Snapshot Only*. You can select a different tiering policy based on your  needs.
... Click *Next*.

== Changing the volume's service level

After you create a volume, you can change the service level at any time as long as the destination capacity pool already exists.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and select *Change service level*.

. Select the capacity pool that provides the service level that you want.

. Click *Change*.

.Result

The volume is moved to the other capacity pool with no impact to the volume.

== Managing Snapshot copies

Snapshot copies provide a point-in-time copy of your volume. Create Snapshot copies, restore the data to a new volume, and delete Snapshot copies.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and choose one of the available options to manage Snapshot copies:

* *Create a Snapshot copy*
* *Revert volume to Snapshot*

== Deleting volumes

Delete the volumes that you no longer need.

.Steps

. Open the working environment.

. Hover over the volume and click *Delete*.

. Confirm that you want to delete the volume.

== Removing Azure NetApp Files

This action removes Azure NetApp Files from Cloud Manager. It doesn't delete your Azure NetApp Files account or volumes. You can add Azure NetApp Files back to Cloud Manager at any time.

.Steps

. Open the Azure NetApp Files working environment.

. At the top right of the page, select the actions menu and click *Remove Azure NetApp Files*.
