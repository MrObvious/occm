The Digital Wallet page enables you to manage licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Backup from a single location. You can add new licenses and update existing licenses.

== Manage Cloud Volumes ONTAP licenses

You can manage the following types of licenses for Cloud Volumes ONTAP:

* Bring your own license (BYOL), which are licenses that you purchase from NetApp.
* Pay as you go, which are hourly or annual subscriptions from your cloud provider's marketplace.
* Eval licenses, which are evaluation licenses that you can later convert to the BYOL licensing model.

=== Manage BYOL system licenses

A system license is required for each Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

==== Obtain a system license file

In most cases, Cloud Manager can automatically obtain your license file using your NetApp Support Site account. But if it can't, then you'll need to manually upload the license file. If you don't have the license file, you can obtain it from netapp.com.

.Steps

. Go to the https://register.netapp.com/register/getlicensefile[NetApp License File Generator^] and log in using your NetApp Support Site credentials.

. Enter your password, choose your product, enter the serial number, confirm that you have read and accepted the privacy policy, and then click *Submit*.

*Example*

. Choose whether you want to receive the serialnumber.NLF JSON file through email or direct download.

==== Update a system license

When you renew a BYOL subscription by contacting a NetApp representative, Cloud Manager automatically obtains the new license from NetApp and installs it on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

If Cloud Manager can't access the license file over the secure internet connection, you can obtain the file yourself and then manually upload the file to Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. Click *Settings > Digital Wallet*.

. In the *BYOL* tab, expand the details for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Click the action menu next to the system license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file (or files if you have an HA pair).

. Click *Update License*.

.Result

Cloud Manager updates the license on the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

=== Manage BYOL extra capacity licenses

You can purchase extra capacity licenses for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP BYOL system to allocate more than the 368 TB of capacity that's provided with a BYOL system license. For example, you might purchase one extra license capacity to allocate up to 736 TB of capacity to Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Or you could purchase three extra capacity licenses to get up to 1.4 PB.

The number of licenses that you can purchase for a single node system or HA pair is unlimited.

==== Add capacity licenses

Purchase an extra capacity license by contacting us through the chat icon in the lower-right of Cloud Manager. After you purchase the license, you can apply it to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. Click *Settings > Digital Wallet*.

. In the *BYOL* tab, expand the details for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Click *Add Capacity License*.

. Enter the serial number or upload the license file (or files if you have an HA pair).

. Click *Add Capacity License*.

==== Update capacity licenses

If you extended the term of an extra capacity license, you'll need to update the license in Cloud Manager.

.Steps

. Click *Settings > Digital Wallet*.

. In the *BYOL* tab, expand the details for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Click the action menu next to the capacity license and select *Update License*.

. Upload the license file (or files if you have an HA pair).

. Click *Update License*.

==== Remove capacity licenses

If an extra capacity license expired and is no longer in use, then you can remove it at any time.

.Steps

. Click *Settings > Digital Wallet*.

. In the *BYOL* tab, expand the details for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Click the action menu next to the capacity license and select *Remove License*.

. Click *Remove*.

=== Convert an Eval license to BYOL

An evaluation license is good for 30 days. You can apply a new BYOL license on top of the evaluation license for an in-place upgrade (this requires a restart of single node systems).

.Steps

. Click *Settings > Digital Wallet*.

. Click *Eval*.

. In the table, click *Convert to BYOL License* for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

. Enter the serial number or upload the license file.

. Click *Convert License*.

== Manage Cloud Backup licenses

A Backup license enables you to use Cloud Backup for a certain period of time and for a maximum amount of backup space. The Backup BYOL license applies to all Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises systems associated with your Cloud Central account.
