Gain control of the costs related to the data on your organizations' storage resources. Cloud Compliance identifies the amount of stale data, non-business data, and very large files in your systems so you can decide whether you want to remove or tier some files to less expensive object storage.

Additionally, if you are planning to migrate data from on-premises locations to the cloud, you can view the size of the data and whether any of the data contains sensitive information prior to moving it.

== The Governance dashboard

The Governance dashboard provides information so that you can increase the efficiency and control the costs related to the data stored on your storage resources.
